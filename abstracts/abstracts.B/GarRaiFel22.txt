Introduction to the Special Issue on: Grey Literature and Multivocal Literature Reviews (MLRs) in software engineering.


In parallel to academic (peer-reviewed) literature (e.g., journal and conference papers), an enormous extent of
grey literature (GL) has accumulated since the inception of software engineering (SE).
{{}}
GL is often defined as
"literature that is not formally published in sources such as books or journal articles"ï¿½, e.g., in the form of trade
magazines, online blog-posts, technical reports, and online videos such as tutorial and presentation videos.
{{}}
GL is
typically produced by SE practitioners.
{{}}
We have observed that researchers are increasingly using and benefitting
from the knowledge available within GL.
{{}}
Related to the notion of GL is the notion of Multivocal Literature
Reviews (MLRs) in SE, i.e., a MLR is a form of a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) which includes knowledge
and/or evidence from the GL in addition to the peer-reviewed literature.
{{}}
MLRs are useful for both researchers
and practitioners because they provide summaries of both the state-of-the-art and -practice in a given area.
{{}}
MLRs
are popular in other fields and have started to appear in SE community.
{{}}
It is timely then for a Special Issue (SI)
focusing on GL and MLRs in SE.
{{}}
From the pool of 13 submitted papers, and after following a rigorous peer review
process, seven papers were accepted for this SI.
{{}}
In this introduction we provide a brief overview of GL and MLRs
in SE, and then a brief summary of the seven papers published in this SI.
