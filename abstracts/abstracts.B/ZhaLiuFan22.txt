Research on Third-Party Libraries in Android Apps: A Taxonomy and Systematic Literature Review.

Third-party libraries (TPLs) have been widely used in mobile apps, which play an essential part in the entire Android
ecosystem.

However, TPL is a double-edged sword.
{{background}}
On the one hand, it can ease the development of mobile apps.
{{background}}
On the other hand,
it also brings security risks such as privacy leaks or increased attack surfaces (e.g., by introducing over-privileged permissions) to
mobile apps.
{{background}}
Although there are already many studies for characterizing third-party libraries, including automated detection, security
and privacy analysis of TPLs, TPL attributes analysis, etc., what strikes us odd is that there is no systematic study to summarize those
studiesâ€™ endeavors.
{{background,need}}
To this end, we conduct the first systematic literature review on Android TPL-related research.
{{objective}}
Following a welldefined systematic literature review protocol, we collected 74 primary research papers closely related to Android third-party library from
2012 to 2020.
{{method}}
After carefully examining these studies, we designed a taxonomy of TPL-related research studies and conducted a
systematic study to summarize current solutions, limitations, challenges and possible implications of new research directions related to
third-party library analysis.
{{method,a-result}}
We hope that these contributions can give readers a clear overview of existing TPL-related studies and
inspire them to go beyond the current status quo by advancing the discipline with innovative approaches.
