An automated test data generation method for void pointers and function pointers in C/C++ libraries and embedded projects.

Automated test data generation for unit testing C/C++ functions using concolic methods is well-known
for improving software quality while reducing human testing effort.
{{background}}
However, there have been only a few
researches related to generating test data for void pointers and function pointers which are commonly used
in C/C++ libraries and embedded projects.
{{gap}}
This paper proposes a concolic-based method named VFP (V oid
and F unction Pointers test data generation) to generate test data for void pointers and function pointers.
{{objective}}
The
key idea of VFP method is to preprocess the source code of the project under test to find all possible types
of void pointers and references of function pointers.
{{design}}
These types and references are used in the initial test
data generating phase of the concolic testing method.
{{design}}
VFP method is implemented in VFP verification tool to
test on various C/C++ libraries and embedded projects.
{{design}}
The experimental results show that VFP significantly
improves the coverage of the generated test data in comparison with existing methods.
