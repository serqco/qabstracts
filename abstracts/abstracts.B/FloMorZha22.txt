An empirical study of data constraint implementations in Java.

Software systems are designed according to guidelines and constraints defined by business
rules.
{{background}}
Some of these constraints define the allowable or required values for data handled
by the systems.
{{background}}
These data constraints usually originate from the problem domain (e.g.,
regulations), and developers must write code that enforces them.
{{background}}
Understanding how data
constraints are implemented is essential for testing, debugging, and software change.
{{background}}
Unfortunately, there are no widely-accepted guidelines or best practices on how to implement data
constraints.
{{gap}}
This paper presents an empirical study that investigates how data constraints are
implemented in Java.
{{objective}}
We study the implementation of 187 data constraints extracted from
the documentation of eight real-world Java software systems.
{{method}}
First, we perform a qualitative
analysis of the textual description of data constraints and identify four data constraint types.
{{method,result}}
Second, we manually identify the implementations of these data constraints and reveal that
they can be grouped into 31 implementation patterns.
{{method,result}}
The analysis of these implementation patterns indicates that developers prefer a handful of patterns when implementing
data constraints.
{{result:i1}}
We also found evidence suggesting that deviations from these patterns are
associated with unusual implementation decisions or code smells.
{{result}}
Third, we develop a toolassisted protocol that allows us to identify 256 additional trace links for the data constraints
implemented using the 13 most common patterns.
{{method,result}}
We find that almost half of these data
constraints have multiple enforcing statements, which are code clones of different types.
{{result}}
Finally, a study with 16 professional developers indicates that the patterns we describe can
be easily and accurately recognized in Java code.
