CT-IoT: a combinatorial testing-based path selection framework for effective IoT testing.

Testing Internet of Things (IoT) systems is challenging.
{{}}
This is not only because of the various
aspects of IoT systems, such as software, hardware, and network that need to be tested, but also
because of the unexpected issues caused by a large number of heterogeneous devices brought
together by IoT systems.
{{}}
When an IoT system has hundreds, or even thousands, of heterogeneous devices, which devices should be tested to detect more faults?
{{}}
How can we systematically test an IoT system and its numerous devices in a cost-effective way?
{{}}
Are there any
coverage criteria for testers to evaluate the thoroughness of the testing against IoT systems?
{{}}
In
this paper, we present a combinatorial testing path selection framework for IoT systems, called
CT-IoT, that systematically identifies and recommends testing paths in IoT systems for
effective testing.
{{}}
We also propose four coverage criteria that can help testers evaluate the
testing thoroughness for IoT systems.
{{}}
We conducted an empirical study of CT-IoT on two realworld IoT systems and evaluated the effectiveness of CT-IoT in terms of coverage achievements.
{{}}
The results show the superiority of CT-IoT over a random approach.
