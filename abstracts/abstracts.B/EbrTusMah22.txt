Classifying Mobile Applications Using Word Embeddings.


Modern application stores enable developers to classify their apps by choosing from a set of generic categories,
or genres, such as health, games, and music.
{{background}}
These categories are typically staticâ€”new categories do not necessarily emerge over time to reflect innovations in the mobile software landscape.
{{background,-ignorediff}}
With thousands of apps
classified under each category, locating apps that match a specific consumer interest can be a challenging task.
{{gap}}
To overcome this challenge, in this article, we propose an automated approach for classifying mobile apps into
more focused categories of functionally related application domains.
{{objective}}
Our aim is to enhance apps visibility and
discoverability.
{{objective}}
Specifically, we employ word embeddings to generate numeric semantic representations of
app descriptions.
{{design}}
These representations are then classified to generate more cohesive categories of apps.
{{design}}
Our
empirical investigation is conducted using a dataset of 600 apps, sampled from the Education, Health&Fitness,
and Medical categories of the Apple App Store.
{{method}}
The results show that our classification algorithms achieve
their best performance when app descriptions are vectorized using GloVe, a count-based model of word embeddings.
{{result:i1}}
Our findings are further validated using a dataset of Sharing Economy apps and the results are
evaluated by 12 human subjects.
{{method}}
The results show that GloVe combined with Support Vector Machines can
produce app classifications that are aligned to a large extent with human-generated classifications.

Disagreement in sentence 2: it is not clear which challenge is being overcome (locating relevant apps vs. classifying apps correctly)
