Pitfalls and guidelines for using time-based Git data.

Many software engineering research papers rely on time-based data (e.g., commit timestamps, issue report creation/update/close dates, release dates).
{{background}}
Like most real-world data
however, time-based data is often dirty.
{{background}}
To date, there are no studies that quantify how frequently such data is used by the software engineering research community, or investigate
sources of and quantify how often such data is dirty.
{{background}}
Depending on the research task and
method used, including such dirty data could affect the research results.
{{background}}
This paper presents
an extended survey of papers that utilize time-based data, published in the Mining Software
Repositories (MSR) conference series.
{{objective}}
Out of the 754 technical track and data papers published in MSR 2004â€“2021, we saw at least 290 (38%) papers utilized time-based data.
{{result}}
We
also observed that most time-based data used in research papers comes in the form of Git
commits, often from GitHub.
{{result:i1}}
Based on those results, we then used the Boa and Software
Heritage infrastructures to help identify and quantify several sources of dirty Git timestamp
data.
{{method:u1,a-result}}
Finally we provide guidelines/best practices for researchers utilizing time-based data
from Git repositories.
