Test case recommendation based on balanced distance of test targets.

Context:
{{h-background}}
Unit testing has been widely regarded as an effective technique to ensure software quality.
{{background}}
Writing
unit test cases is time-consuming and requires developers to have abundant knowledge and experience.
{{background}}
Automated test case generation, a promising technology for liberating developers and improving test efficiency,
currently performs not satisfactory in real-world projects.
{{background}}
As a complement, test case recommendation (TCR)
has been receiving the attention of researchers.
{{background}}
TCR can improve the efficiency of test case writing by
recommending test case code to developers for their reference and reuse.
{{background}}
The overarching idea of TCR
techniques is that two similar test targets can reuse each otherâ€™s test cases.
{{background}}
Objective:
{{h-objective}}
Existing TCR techniques either fail to recommend relevant test cases for a given test target or are
vulnerable to the mismatch of test target signatures.
{{gap}}
Our objective is to effectively and robustly recommend
relevant test cases for test targets given by developers.
{{objective}}
Method:
{{h-method}}
In this paper, we propose a novel TCR technique that measures the similarity of test targets based on
a balanced distance.
{{design}}
The balanced distance integrates the distances on code snippets and comments, making
the measurement of test target similarity more accurate and robust.
{{design}}
In particular, we take the distance on
control flows into account to compensate for the shortcomings in measuring the similarity only based on the
literal text of code snippets.
{{design}}
As a proof-of-concept application, we implement a test case recommender named
BDTCR.
{{design}}
Results:
{{h-result}}
We construct a test case corpus containing more than 13,000 test cases collected from GitHub.
{{method}}
Based
on this corpus, we conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness and usefulness of BDTCR.
{{method}}
The experimental results show that BDTCR can effectively recommend relevant test cases and outperform the
state-of-the-art techniques.
{{result:i2}}
Conclusion:
{{h-conclusion}}
It can be concluded that (1) BDTCR is an effective TCR technique; (2) BDTCR is a robust TCR
technique that can effectively resist the interference of the mismatch of test target signatures; (3) BDTCR is
practical to help developers write test cases quickly and effectively.
