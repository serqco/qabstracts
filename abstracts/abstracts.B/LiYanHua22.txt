Towards Practical Robustness Analysis for DNNs based on PAC-Model Learning.

To analyse local robustness properties of deep neural networks
(DNNs), we present a practical framework from a model learn-
ing perspective.
{{background}}
Based on black-box model learning with scenario
optimisation, we abstract the local behaviour of a DNN via an
affine model with the probably approximately correct (PAC) guar-
antee.
{{objective}}
From the learned model, we can infer the corresponding
PAC-model robustness property.
{{objective}}
The innovation of our work is the
integration of model learning into PAC robustness analysis:
that is,
we construct a PAC guarantee on the model level instead of sample
distribution, which induces a more faithful and accurate robustness
evaluation.
{{design}}
This is in contrast to existing statistical methods with-
out model learning.
{{design}}
We implement our method in a prototypical
tool named DeepPAC.
{{design}}
As a black-box method, DeepPAC is scalable
and efficient, especially when DNNs have complex structures or
high-dimensional inputs.
{{design}}
We extensively evaluate DeepPAC, with 4
baselines (using formal verification, statistical methods, testing and
adversarial attack) and 20 DNN models across 3 datasets, including
MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet.
{{method}}
It is shown that DeepPAC out-
performs the state-of-the-art statistical method PROVERO, and it
achieves more practical robustness analysis than the formal ver-
ification tool ERAN.
{{result:i2}}
Also, its results are consistent with existing
DNN testing work like DeepGini.
