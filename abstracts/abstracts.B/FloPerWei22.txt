Retrieving Data Constraint Implementations Using Fine-Grained Code Patterns.

Business rules are an important part of the requirements of soft-
ware systems that are meant to support an organization.
{{background}}
These rules
describe the operations, definitions, and constraints that apply to
the organization.
{{background}}
Within the software system, business rules are
often translated into constraints on the values that are required or
allowed for data, called data constraints.
{{background}}
Business rules are subject
to frequent changes, which in turn require changes to the corre-
sponding data constraints in the software.
{{background}}
The ability to efficiently
and precisely identify where data constraints are implemented in
the source code is essential for performing such necessary changes.
{{background}}
In this paper, we introduce Lasso, the first technique that au-
tomatically retrieves the method and line of code where a given
data constraint is enforced.
{{objective}}
Lasso is based on traceability link re-
covery approaches and leverages results from recent research that
identified line-of-code level implementation patterns for data con-
straints.
{{design}}
We implement three versions of Lasso that can retrieve
data constraint implementations when they are implemented with
any one of 13 frequently occurring patterns.
{{design}}
We evaluate the three
versions on a set of 299 data constraints from 15 real-world Java
systems, and find that they improve method-level link recovery
by 30%, 70%, and 163%, in terms of true positives within the first
10 results, compared to their text-retrieval-based baseline.
{{method,result}}
More
importantly, the Lasso variants correctly identify the line of code
implementing the constraint inside the methods for 68% of the 299
constraints.
