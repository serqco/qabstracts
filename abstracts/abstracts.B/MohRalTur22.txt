How Templated Requirements Specifications Inhibit Creativity in Software Engineering.

Desiderata is a general term for stakeholder needs, desires or preferences.
{{}}
Recent experiments demonstrate that
presenting desiderata as templated requirements specifications leads to less creative solutions.
{{}}
However, these experiments do not
establish how the presentation of desiderata affects design creativity.
{{}}
This study, therefore, aims to explore the cognitive mechanisms
by which presenting desiderata as templated requirements specifications reduces creativity during software design.
{{}}
Forty-two software
designers, organized into 21 pairs, participated in a dialog-based protocol study.
{{}}
Their interactions were transcribed and the transcripts
were analyzed in two ways:
{{}}
(1) using inductive process coding and (2) using an a-priori coding scheme focusing on fixation and critical
thinking.
{{}}
Process coding shows that participants exhibited seven categories of behavior:
{{}}
making design moves, uncritically accepting,
rejecting, grouping, questioning, assuming and considering quality criteria.
{{}}
Closed coding shows that participants tend to accept given
requirements and priority levels while rejecting newer, more innovative design ideas.
{{}}
Overall, the results suggest that designers fixate
on desiderata presented as templated requirements specifications, hindering critical thinking.
{{}}
More precisely, requirements fixation
mediates the negative relationship between specification formality and creativity.
