SAPIENTML: Synthesizing Machine Learning Pipelines by Learning from Human-Written Solutions.

Automatic machine learning, or AutoML, holds the promise of truly
democratizing the use of machine learning (ML), by substantially
automating the work of data scientists.
{{background}}
However, the huge com-
binatorial search space of candidate pipelines means that current
AutoML techniques, generate sub-optimal pipelines, or none at
all, especially on large, complex datasets.
{{gap}}
In this work we propose
an AutoML technique SapientML, that can learn from a corpus
of existing datasets and their human-written pipelines, and effi-
ciently generate a high-quality pipeline for a predictive task on
a new dataset.
{{objective}}
To combat the search space explosion of AutoML,
SapientML employs a novel divide-and-conquer strategy realized
as a three-stage program synthesis approach, that reasons on suc-
cessively smaller search spaces.
{{design}}
The first stage uses meta-learning
to predict a set of plausible ML components to constitute a pipeline.
{{design}}
In the second stage, this is then refined into a small pool of vi-
able concrete pipelines using a pipeline dataflow model derived
from the corpus.
{{design}}
Dynamically evaluating these few pipelines, in the
third stage, provides the best solution.
{{design}}
We instantiate SapientML
as part of a fully automated tool-chain that creates a cleaned, la-
beled learning corpus by mining Kaggle, learns from it, and uses
the learned models to then synthesize pipelines for new predictive
tasks.
{{design}}
We have created a training corpus of 1,094 pipelines spanning
170 datasets, and evaluated SapientML on a set of 41 benchmark
datasets, including 10 new, large, real-world datasets from Kaggle,
and against 3 state-of-the-art AutoML tools and 4 baselines.
{{method}}
Our
evaluation shows that SapientML produces the best or comparable
accuracy on 27 of the benchmarks while the second best tool fails
to even produce a pipeline on 9 of the instances.
{{result}}
This difference
is amplified on the 10 most challenging benchmarks, where Sapi-
entML wins on 9 instances with the other tools failing to produce
pipelines on 4 or more benchmarks.
