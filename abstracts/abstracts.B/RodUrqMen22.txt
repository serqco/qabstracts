A Theory of Value for Value-Based Feature Selection in Software Engineering.

Value-Based Software Engineering stresses the role of value in software related decisions.
{{background}}
In the context of feature
selection, software features judged to provide higher value take priority in the development process.
{{background}}
This paper focuses on what
value means when selecting software features.
{{objective}}
Using grounded theory, we conducted and analyzed semi-structured interviews with
21 key stakeholders (decision-makers) from three software/software-intensive companies, within a context where value-based
decision-making was already established.
{{method}}
Our analysis led to the building of a theory of value for value-based feature selection that
identifies the nature of value propositions considered by key stakeholders when selecting software features (i.e., decision-making
criteria for deciding upon software features, as suggested by Boehm (2003)).
{{result}}
We found that some value propositions were common to
all three company cases (core value propositions), whereas others were dependent upon the context in which a company operates,
and the characteristics of the product under development (specific value propositions).
{{result}}
Moreover, value propositions vary according to
the stakeholder group and the type of feature being assessed.
{{result}}
Our study provides significant insight into value in the context of feature
selection, and generates new concepts around value-based feature selection such as new value propositions.
