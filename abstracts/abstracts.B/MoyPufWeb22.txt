Uses of business process modeling in agile software development projects.

Context:
{{}}
Agile methodologies and frameworks are widely used in software development projects because of
their support for continuous change and delivery.
{{}}
Agile software development advocates de-prioritizing aspects
such as processes and documentation.
{{}}
In traditional software engineering methodologies, however, business
process models have been extensively used to support these aspects.
{{}}
Up until now, it is unclear to what extent
recommendations to focus on code imply that conceptual modeling should be discontinued.
{{}}
Objective:
{{}}
The objective of this study is to investigate this hypothesis.
{{}}
More specifically, we develop
a theoretical argument of how business process models are and can be used to support agile software
development projects.
{{}}
Method:
{{}}
To this end, we use a multi-method study design.
{{}}
First, we conduct a systematic literature review,
in which we identify studies on the usage of business process models in agile software development.
{{}}
Second,
we apply procedures from thematic synthesis to analyze the connection between these uses and the phases of
the development cycle.
{{}}
Third, we use a focus group design with practitioners to systematically reflect upon
how these uses can help regarding four categories of challenges in agile software development:
{{}}
management,
team, technology, and process.
{{}}
Results:
{{}}
From 37 relevant studies, we distill 15 different uses.
{{}}
The results highlight the benefits of process
modeling as an instrument to support agile software development projects from different angles and in all
project phases.
{{}}
Process modeling appears to be particularly relevant for the first phases of the development
cycle, and for management and process issues in agile projects.
{{}}
Conclusion:
{{}}
We conclude that business process models indeed provide benefits for agile software development
projects.
{{}}
Our findings have practical implications and emphasize the need for future research on modeling and
agile development.
