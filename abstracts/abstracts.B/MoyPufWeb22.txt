Uses of business process modeling in agile software development projects.

Context:
{{h-background}}
Agile methodologies and frameworks are widely used in software development projects because of
their support for continuous change and delivery.
{{background}}
Agile software development advocates de-prioritizing aspects
such as processes and documentation.
{{background}}
In traditional software engineering methodologies, however, business
process models have been extensively used to support these aspects.
{{background}}
Up until now, it is unclear to what extent
recommendations to focus on code imply that conceptual modeling should be discontinued.
{{gap}}
Objective:
{{h-objective}}
The objective of this study is to investigate this hypothesis.
{{objective}}
More specifically, we develop
a theoretical argument of how business process models are and can be used to support agile software
development projects.
{{objective}}
Method:
{{h-method}}
To this end, we use a multi-method study design.
{{method}}
First, we conduct a systematic literature review,
in which we identify studies on the usage of business process models in agile software development.
{{method}}
Second,
we apply procedures from thematic synthesis to analyze the connection between these uses and the phases of
the development cycle.
{{method}}
Third, we use a focus group design with practitioners to systematically reflect upon
how these uses can help regarding four categories of challenges in agile software development:
{{method:i1}}
management,
team, technology, and process.
{{method}}
Results:
{{h-result}}
From 37 relevant studies, we distill 15 different uses.
{{result}}
The results highlight the benefits of process
modeling as an instrument to support agile software development projects from different angles and in all
project phases.
{{result}}
Process modeling appears to be particularly relevant for the first phases of the development
cycle, and for management and process issues in agile projects.
{{result}}
Conclusion:
{{h-conclusion}}
We conclude that business process models indeed provide benefits for agile software development
projects.
{{conclusion}}
Our findings have practical implications and emphasize the need for future research on modeling and
agile development.
