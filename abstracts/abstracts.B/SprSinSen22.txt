Building Maintainable Software Using Abstraction Layering.

Increased software maintainability can help improve
a companyâ€™s profitability by directly reducing ongoing software
development costs.
{{}}
Abstraction Layered Architecture (ALA) is a
reference architecture for building maintainable applications, but
its effectiveness in commercial projects has remained unexplored.
{{}}
This research, carried out as a 16-month joint industry-academic
project, explores developing commercial code bases using ALA
and the extent to which ALA improves maintainability.
{{}}
An existing application from Datamars, New Zealand, was re-developed
by using ALA and compared with the original application.
{{}}
In
order to carry out these comparisons, we developed suitable
measures by adapting maintainability characteristics from the
ISO 25010 family of standards.
{{}}
Specifically, we determined
metrics to capture the five sub-characteristics of maintainability:
{{}}
modularity, reusability, analysability, modifiability, and testability; and used them to test our hypothesis that the use of ALA
improved maintainability of the application.
{{}}
During the evaluation, we found that the modularity, reusability, analysability,
and testability of the re-developed ALA application were higher
than for the original application.
{{}}
The modifiability of the ALAbased application was lower in the short-term, but shown to
trend upwards in the longer term.
{{}}
Our findings led to proposing
a generalised ALA-based development method that promises a
significant reduction in maintenance costs.
