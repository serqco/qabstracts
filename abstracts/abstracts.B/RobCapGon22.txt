Development effort estimation in free/open source software from activity in version control systems.

Effort estimation models are a fundamental tool in software management, and used as a forecast for resources, constraints and costs associated to software development.

For Free/Open
Source Software (FOSS) projects, effort estimation is especially complex:

professional
developers work alongside occasional, volunteer developers, so the overall effort (in personmonths) becomes non-trivial to determine.
{{gap}}
The objective of this work it to develop a simple
effort estimation model for FOSS projects, based on the historic data of developersâ€™ effort.
{{objective,design}}
The model is fed with direct developer feedback to ensure its accuracy.
{{design}}
After extracting
the personal development profiles of several thousands of developers from 6 large FOSS
projects, we asked them to fill in a questionnaire to determine if they should be considered
as full-time developers in the project that they work in.
{{design}}
Their feedback was used to finetune the value of an effort threshold, above which developers can be considered as full-time.
{{design}}
With the help of the over 1,000 questionnaires received, we were able to determine, for
every project in our sample, the threshold of commits that separates full-time from non-fulltime developers.
{{design,a-result}}
We finally offer guidelines and a tool to apply our model to FOSS projects
that use a version control system.
