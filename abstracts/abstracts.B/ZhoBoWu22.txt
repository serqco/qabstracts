SPVF: security property assisted vulnerability fixing via attention-based models.

The past few years have witnessed the wide application of machine learning models to fix
vulnerabilities automatically.
{{background}}
However, existing approaches cannot capture the characteristics of vulnerabilities that are helpful to improve the effectiveness of automated vulnerability
fixing.
{{gap}}
In this paper, we propose a novel approach for automatically fixing vulnerabilities,
called SPVF.
{{objective}}
SPVF captures the security property from the descriptive information about
the vulnerability.
{{objective}}
SPVF is based on the attention mechanism and uses the abstract syntax
tree as well as the security properties, integrating them using the pointer generator.
{{design}}
The
experimental results on two public datasets show that SPVF outperforms the state-of-the-art
approaches by 13% for C/C++ and 47% for Python.
{{method,result:i1}}
And SPVF is capable of successfully
fixing 153 C/C++ vulnerabilities and 276 Python vulnerabilities.
