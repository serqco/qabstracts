Ambiguity in user stories: A systematic literature review.

Context:
{{h-background}}
Ambiguity in user stories is a problem that has received little research attention.
{{gap}}
Due to the absence of
review studies, it is not known how and to what extent this problem, which impacts the effectiveness of user
stories in supporting systems development, has been solved.
{{gap}}
Objectives:
{{h-objective}}
We review the studies that investigate or develop solutions for problems related to ambiguity in user
stories.
{{objective}}
We investigate how these problems manifest themselves, what their causes and consequences are, what
solutions have been proposed and what evidence of their effectiveness has been presented.
{{objective}}
Based on the insights
we obtain from this review, we identify research gaps and suggest opportunities for future research.
{{objective}}
Methods:
{{h-method}}
We followed Systematic Literature Review guidelines to review problems investigated, solutions pro­
posed, and validation/evaluation methods used.
{{method}}
We classified the reviewed studies according to the four lin­
guistic levels of ambiguity (i.e., lexical, syntactic, semantic, pragmatic) proposed by Berry and Kamsties to obtain
insights from patterns that we observe in the classification of problems and solutions.
{{method}}
Results:
{{h-result}}
A total of 36 studies published in 2001–2020 investigated ambiguity in user stories.
{{result}}
Based on four
patterns we discern, we identify three research gaps.
{{result}}
First, we need more research on human behaviors and
cognitive factors causing ambiguity.
{{fneed}}
Second, ambiguity is seldom studied as a problem of a set of related user
stories, like a theme or epic in Scrum.
{{fgap}}
Third, there is a lack of holistic solution approaches that consider am­
biguity at multiple linguistic levels.
{{fgap}}
Conclusion:
{{h-conclusion}}
Ambiguity in user stories is a known problem.
{{conclusion:timid}}
However, a comprehensive solution for addressing
ambiguity in a set of related user stories as it manifests itself at different linguistic levels as a cognitive problem is
lacking.
