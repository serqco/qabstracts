The Best Laid Plans or Lack Thereof: Security Decision-Making of Different Stakeholder Groups.

Cyber security requirements are influenced by the priorities and decisions of a range of stakeholders.
{{background}}
Board members
and Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) determine strategic priorities.
{{background}}
Managers have responsibility for resource allocation
and project management.
{{background}}
Legal professionals concern themselves with regulatory compliance.
{{background}}
Little is understood about how the
security decision-making approaches of these different stakeholders contrast, and if particular groups of stakeholders have a better
appreciation of security requirements during decision-making.

Are risk analysts better decision makers than CISOs?

Do security
experts exhibit more effective strategies than board members?

This paper explores the effect that different experience and diversity
of expertise has on the quality of a teamâ€™s cyber security decision-making and whether teams with members from more varied
backgrounds perform better than those with more focused, homogeneous skill sets.
{{objective}}
Using data from 208 sessions and 948 players of
a tabletop game run in the wild by a major national organization over 16 months, we explore how choices are affected by player
background (e.g., cyber security experts versus risk analysts, board-level decision makers versus technical experts) and different
team make-ups (homogeneous teams of security experts versus various mixes).
{{method}}
We find that no group of experts makes significantly
better game decisions than anyone else, and that their biases lead them to not fully comprehend what they are defending or how the
defenses work.
