A systematic process for Mining Software Repositories: Results from a systematic literature review.

Context:
{{h-background}}
Mining Software Repositories (MSR) is a growing area of Software Engineering (SE) research.
{{background}}
Since
their emergence in 2004, many investigations have analysed different aspects of these studies.
{{background}}
However, there
are no guidelines on how to conduct systematic MSR studies.
{{gap}}
There is a need to evaluate how MSR research
is approached to provide a framework to do so systematically.
{{need}}
Objective:
{{h-objective}}
To identify how MSR studies are conducted in terms of repository selection and data extraction.
{{objective}}
To uncover potential for improvement in directing systematic research and providing guidelines to do so.
{{objective}}
Method:
{{h-method}}
A systematic literature review of MSR studies was conducted following the guidelines and template
proposed by Mian et al.
(which refines those provided by Kitchenham and Charters).
{{method}}
These guidelines were
extended and revised to provide a framework for systematic MSR studies.
{{method}}
Results:
{{h-result}}
MSR studies typically do not follow a systematic approach for repository selection, and many do
not report selection or data extraction protocols.
{{result}}
Furthermore, few manuscripts discuss threats to the studyâ€™s
validity due to the selection or data extraction steps followed.
{{result}}
Conclusions:
{{h-conclusion}}
Although MSR studies are evidence-based research, they seldom follow a systematic process.
{{conclusion}}
Hence, there is a need for guidelines on how to conduct systematic MSR studies.
{{conclusion}}
New guidelines and a template
have been proposed, consolidating related studies in the MSR field and strategies for systematic literature
reviews.
