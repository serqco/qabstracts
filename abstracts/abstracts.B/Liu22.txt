All in One: Design, Verification, and Implementation of SNOW-optimal Read Atomic Transactions.

Distributed read atomic transactions are important building blocks of modern cloud databases that magnificently bridge the gap between data availability and strong data consistency.
{{background}}
The performance of their transactional reads is particularly critical to the overall system performance, as many real-world database workloads
are dominated by reads.
{{background}}
Following the SNOW design principle for optimal reads, we develop LORA, a novel
SNOW-optimal algorithm for distributed read atomic transactions.
{{objective}}
LORA completes its reads in exactly one
round trip, even in the presence of conflicting writes, without imposing additional overhead to the communication, and it outperforms the state-of-the-art read atomic algorithms.
{{design,result}}
To guide LORA’s development, we present a rewriting-logic-based framework and toolkit for design, verification, implementation, and evaluation of distributed databases.
{{design}}
Within the framework, we formalize LORA
and mathematically prove its data consistency guarantees.
{{method,result,-ignorediff}}
We also apply automatic model checking and statistical verification to validate our proofs and to estimate LORA’s performance.
{{design,method}}
We additionally generate
from the formal model a correct-by-construction distributed implementation for testing and performance
evaluation under realistic deployments.
{{design,method}}
Our design-level and implementation-based experimental results are
consistent, which together demonstrate LORA’s promising data consistency and performance achievement.
