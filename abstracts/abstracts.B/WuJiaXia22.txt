One Fuzzing Strategy to Rule Them All.

Coverage-guided fuzzing has become mainstream in fuzzing to
automatically expose program vulnerabilities.
{{background}}
Recently, a group of
fuzzers are proposed to adopt a random search mechanism namely
Havoc, explicitly or implicitly, to augment their edge exploration.
{{background}}
However, they only tend to adopt the default setup of Havoc as an
implementation option while none of them attempts to explore its
power under diverse setups or inspect its rationale for potential
improvement.
{{gap}}
In this paper, to address such issues, we conduct
the first empirical study on Havoc to enhance the understanding
of its characteristics.
{{objective}}
Specifically, we first find that applying the
default setup of Havoc to fuzzers can significantly improve their
edge coverage performance.
{{result}}
Interestingly, we further observe that
even simply executing Havoc itself without appending it to any
fuzzer can lead to strong edge coverage performance and outper-
form most of our studied fuzzers.
{{result:i2}}
Moreover, we also extend the
execution time of Havoc and find that most fuzzers can not only
achieve significantly higher edge coverage, but also tend to perform
similarly (i.e., their performance gaps get largely bridged).
{{result:i2}}
Inspired
by the findings, we further propose Havoc𝑀𝐴𝐵 , which models the
Havoc mutation strategy as a multi-armed bandit problem to be
solved by dynamically adjusting the mutation strategy.
{{objective}}
The evalua-
tion result presents that Havoc𝑀𝐴𝐵 can significantly increase the
edge coverage by 11.1% on average for all the benchmark projects
compared with Havoc and even slightly outperform state-of-the-art
QSYM which augments its computing resource by adopting three
parallel threads.

We further execute Havoc𝑀𝐴𝐵 with three parallel
