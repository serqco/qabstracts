A Study on Blockchain Architecture Design Decisions and Their Security Attacks and Threats.


Blockchain is a disruptive technology intended to implement secure decentralised distributed systems, in
which transactional data can be shared, stored, and verified by participants of the system without needing
a central authentication/verification authority.
{{background}}
Blockchain-based systems have several architectural components and variants, which architects can leverage to build secure software systems.
{{background}}
However, there is a lack
of studies to assist architects in making architecture design and configuration decisions for blockchain-based
systems.
{{gap}}
This knowledge gap may increase the chance of making unsuitable design decisions and producing
configurations prone to potential security risks.
{{gap}}
To address this limitation, we report our comprehensive systematic literature review to derive a taxonomy of commonly used architecture design decisions in blockchainbased systems.
{{objective}}
We map each of these decisions to potential security attacks and their posed threats.
{{objective}}
MITRE’s
attack tactic categories and Microsoft STRIDE threat modeling are used to systematically classify threats
and their associated attacks to identify potential attacks and threats in blockchain-based systems.
{{method}}
Our mapping approach aims to guide architects to make justifiable design decisions that will result in more secure
implementations.
