Predicting reliability of software in industrial systems using a Petri net based approach: A case study on a safety system used in nuclear power plant.

Context:
{{h-background}}
Software reliability prediction in the early stages of development can be propitious in many ways.
{{background}}
The
combinatorial models used to predict reliability using architectures such as fault trees, binary decision diagrams,
etc.
{{background}}
have limitations in modeling complex system behavior.
{{background}}
On the other hand, state-based models such as
Markov chains suffer from the state-space explosion problem, and they need transition probability among
different system states to measure reliability.
{{background}}
These probabilities are usually assumed or are obtained from the
operational profile for which the system should be used in the field.
{{background}}
Objective:
{{h-objective}}
The objective of this paper is to present a method for predicting the reliability of software in industrial
systems using a generalized stochastic Petri nets based approach.
{{objective}}
The key idea is to violate the assumption of
state transition probabilities in the Markov chain.
{{objective}}
The state transition probabilities are calculated using Petri net
transitions' throughput by performing stationary analysis under the consideration to identify and handle dead
markings in the Petri net.
{{objective}}
Method:
{{h-method}}
Initially, a generalized stochastic Petri net of the system under consideration is generated from the
standard system's specification.
{{design}}
Thereafter, dead markings are identified in the Petri net which are further
removed to perform steady-state analysis.
{{design}}
At last, a Markov model is generated based on the reachability graph of
the Petri net, which is further used to predict the system reliability.
{{design}}
Results:
{{h-result}}
The presented method has been applied to a safety-critical system, Shut Down System-1, of a nuclear
power plant, which is operational in the Canada Deuterium Uranium reactor.
{{method}}
The predicted reliability of the
system using this method is 99.99966% which has been validated using the specified system requirements.
{{result,method}}
To
further validate and generalize the results, sensitivity analysis is performed by varying different system
parameters.
{{method}}
Conclusions:
{{h-conclusion}}
The method discussed in this paper presents a step of performing structural analysis on the Petri net
of the system under consideration to identify and handle dead markings on the Petri net.
{{design}}
It further handles the
issue of assuming transition probabilities among the system states by calculating them using Petri net transitionsâ€™
throughput.
