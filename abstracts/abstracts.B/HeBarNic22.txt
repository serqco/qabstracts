DeepSTL - From English Requirements to Signal Temporal Logic.

Formal methods provide very powerful tools and techniques for the
design and analysis of complex systems.
{{background}}
Their practical application
remains however limited, due to the widely accepted belief that for-
mal methods require extensive expertise and a steep learning curve.
{{background}}
Writing correct formal specifications in form of logical formulas is
still considered to be a difficult and error prone task.
{{gap}}
In this paper we propose DeepSTL, a tool and technique for the
translation of informal requirements, given as free English sen-
tences, into Signal Temporal Logic (STL), a formal specification
language for cyber-physical systems, used both by academia and
advanced research labs in industry.
{{objective}}
A major challenge to devise
such a translator is the lack of publicly available informal require-
ments and formal specifications.
{{design}}
We propose a two-step workflow
to address this challenge.
{{design}}
We first design a grammar-based genera-
tion technique of synthetic data, where each output is a random STL
formula and its associated set of possible English translations.
{{design}}
In
the second step, we use a state-of- the-art transformer-based neural
translation technique, to train an accurate attentional translator
of English to STL.
{{design}}
The experimental results show high transla-
tion quality for patterns of English requirements that have been
well trained, making this workflow promising to be extended for
processing more complex translation tasks.
