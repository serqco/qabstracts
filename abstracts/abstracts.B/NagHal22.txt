How Software Developers Mitigate Their Errors When Developing Code.

Code remains largely hand-made by humans and, as such, writing code is prone to error.
{{background}}
Many previous studies have
focused on the technical reasons for these errors and provided developers with increasingly sophisticated tools.
{{background}}
Few studies have
looked in detail at why code errors have been made from a human perspective.
{{gap}}
We use Human Error Theory to frame our exploratory
study and use semi-structured interviews to uncover a preliminary understanding of the errors developers make while coding.
{{objective,method}}
We look
particularly at the Skill-based (SB) errors reported by 27 professional software developers.
{{method}}
We found that the complexity of the
development environment is one of the most frequently reported reasons for errors.
{{result:i1}}
Maintaining concentration and focus on a particular
task also underpins many developer errors.
{{result}}
We found that developers struggle with effective mitigation strategies for their errors,
reporting strategies largely based on improving their own willpower to concentrate better on coding tasks.
{{result}}
We discuss how using
Reasonâ€™s Swiss Cheese model may help reduce errors during software development.
{{a-conclusion}}
This model ensures that layers of tool, process
and management mitigation are in place to prevent developer errors from causing system failures.
