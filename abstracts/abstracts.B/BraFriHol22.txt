Sources of software development task friction.

Given a task description, a developer’s job is to alter the software system in a way that
accomplishes the task, usually by fixing a bug or adding a new feature.
{{background}}
Completing these
tasks typically requires developers to use multiple tools, spanning multiple applications,
within their environment.
{{background}}
In this paper, we investigate how existing desktop environments
align with and facilitate developers’ needs as they tackle their tasks.
{{objective}}
We examine how
developers use their tools to perform their tasks and the ways in which these tools inhibit
development velocity.
{{method}}
Through a controlled user study with 17 subjects and a field study
with 10 industrial engineers, we found that developers frequently formulate specific objectives, or goals, on-demand as they encounter new information when progressing through
their tasks.
{{method,result}}
These goals are often not achievable directly in the environment, forcing developers to translate their task into goals and their goals into the low-level actions provided
by the environment.
{{result}}
When carrying out these low-level actions, developers routinely perform extra work such as locating and integrating resources and adapting their needs to align
with the capabilities of the environment.
{{result}}
This extra work acts as a form of friction, limiting how quickly and directly developers can complete their tasks.
{{result}}
Much of this extra work
exists due to mismatches between current tools and environments and how developers actually work in practice.
{{result}}
This work identifies seven types of development friction and provides
design recommendations that future tools and environments could use to more effectively
help developers complete their tasks.
