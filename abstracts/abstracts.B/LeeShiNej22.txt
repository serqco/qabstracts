Optimal priority assignment for real-time systems: a coevolution-based approach.

In real-time systems, priorities assigned to real-time tasks determine the order of task executions, by relying on an underlying task scheduling policy.
{{background}}
Assigning optimal priority
values to tasks is critical to allow the tasks to complete their executions while maximizing safety margins from their specified deadlines.
{{background}}
This enables real-time systems to tolerate
unexpected overheads in task executions and still meet their deadlines.
{{background}}
In practice, priority assignments result from an interactive process between the development and testing
teams.
{{background}}
In this article, we propose an automated method that aims to identify the best possible priority assignments in real-time systems, accounting for multiple objectives regarding
safety margins and engineering constraints.
{{objective}}
Our approach is based on a multi-objective,
competitive coevolutionary algorithm mimicking the interactive priority assignment process
between the development and testing teams.
{{design}}
We evaluate our approach by applying it to six
industrial systems from different domains and several synthetic systems.
{{method}}
The results indicate that our approach significantly outperforms both our baselines, i.e., random search and
sequential search, and solutions defined by practitioners.
{{result:i2}}
Our approach scales to complex
industrial systems as an offline analysis method that attempts to find near-optimal solutions
within acceptable time, i.e., less than 16 hours.
