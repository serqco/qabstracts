Towards a model and methodology for evaluating data quality in software engineering experiments.

Context:
{{h-background}}
Data collected during software engineering experiments might contain quality problems, leading to
wrong experimental conclusions.
{{background}}
Objective:
{{h-objective}}
We present a data quality (DQ) model and a methodology specific to software engineering experiments,
which provides a systematic approach in order to analyze and improve data quality in this domain.
{{objective}}
Method:
{{h-method}}
Our proposal considers a multifaceted view of data quality suitable for this context, which enables the
discovery of DQ problems that are not generally addressed.
{{design}}
We successfully applied the model (DQMoS) and
methodology (DQMeS) in four controlled experiments, detecting different quality problems that could impact the
experimental results.
{{method,result}}
We present, through a running example, how we applied the DQMoS and DQMeS to one of
the four experimental data.
{{a-method}}
Results:
{{h-result}}
We found that between 55% and 75% of the DQ metrics applied showed the presence of a DQ problem in
all four experiments.
{{result}}
In all cases, the experimental results had already been obtained before the DQMeS appli­
cation.
{{method}}
This means that the DQ problems we found, were not discovered by the experimenters during or before
making their experiment’s analysis.
{{result}}
Results yield data quality problems that experimenters did not detect on
their own analysis, and that affect the experimental response variables.
{{result}}
Our proposal shows a formalized
framework that measures and improves the quality of software engineering experimental data.
{{summary}}
The results of a
survey distributed to the experiments' responsibles show that they value the improvements introduced by the
model and methodology, and that they intend to apply them again in future experiences.
{{method,result}}
Conclusions:
{{h-conclusion}}
DQMoS and DQMeS are useful to increase the confidence in the quality of data used in software
engineering experiments, and improve the trust in experimental results.
