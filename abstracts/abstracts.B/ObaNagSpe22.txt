Sentiment analysis tools in software engineering: A systematic mapping study.

Context:
{{h-background}}
Software development is a collaborative task.
{{background}}
Previous research has shown social aspects within
development teams to be highly relevant for the success of software projects.
{{background}}
A team's mood has been proven
to be particularly important.
{{background}}
It is paramount for project managers to be aware of negative moods within their
teams, as such awareness enables them to intervene.
{{background}}
Sentiment analysis tools offer a way to determine the
mood of a team based on textual communication.
{{background}}
Objective:
{{h-objective}}
We aim to help developers or stakeholders in their choice of sentiment analysis tools for their
specific purpose.
{{objective}}
Therefore, we conducted a systematic mapping study (SMS).
{{method}}
Methods:
{{h-method}}
We present the results of our SMS of sentiment analysis tools developed for or applied in the context
of software engineering (SE).
{{method}}
Our results summarize insights from 106 papers with respect to (1) the application
domain, (2) the purpose, (3) the used data sets, (4) the approaches for developing sentiment analysis tools,
(5) the usage of already existing tools, and (6) the difficulties researchers face.
{{method}}
We analyzed in more detail
which tools and approaches perform how in terms of their performance.
{{method}}
Results:
{{h-result}}
According to our results, sentiment analysis is frequently applied to open-source software projects,
and most approaches are neural networks or support-vector machines.
{{result:i2}}
The best performing approach in our
analysis is neural networks and the best tool is BERT.
{{result:i1}}
Despite the frequent use of sentiment analysis in SE, there
are open issues, e.g. regarding the identification of irony or sarcasm, pointing to future research directions.
{{result}}
Conclusion:
{{h-conclusion}}
We conducted an SMS to gain an overview of the current state of sentiment analysis in order to
help developers or stakeholders in this matter.
{{summary}}
Our results include interesting findings e.g. on the used tools
and their difficulties.
{{summary}}
We present several suggestions on how to solve these identified problems.

Sentence 21: the sentence is more specific than a fposs; its more a "what can now be *researched*", not just done. There seems to be no code for that, as fwork is only applicable if the authors announce that they will continue researching themselves.
