Erratum: Leveraging Flexible Tree Matching to repair broken locators in web automation scripts.

Web applications are constantly evolving to integrate new features and fix reported bugs.
{{background}}
Even an imperceptible
change can sometimes entail significant modifications of the Document Object Model (DOM), which is the
underlying model used by browsers to render all the elements included in a web application.
{{background}}
Scripts that
interact with web applications (e.g. web test scripts, crawlers, or robotic process automation) rely on this
continuously evolving DOM which means they are often particularly fragile.
{{background}}
More precisely, the major cause
of breakages observed in automation scripts are element locators, which are identifiers used by automation
scripts to navigate across the DOM.
{{background}}
When the DOM evolves, these identifiers tend to break, thus causing the
related scripts to no longer locate the intended target elements.
{{background}}
For this reason, several contributions explored the idea of automatically repairing broken locators on a
page.
{{background}}
These works attempt to repair a given broken locator by scanning all elements in the new DOM to
find the most similar one.
{{background}}
Unfortunately, this approach fails to scale when the complexity of web pages
grows, leading either to long computation times or incorrect element repairs.
{{gap}}
This article, therefore, adopts
a different perspective on this problem by introducing a new locator repair solution that leverages tree
matching algorithms to relocate broken locators.
{{objective}}
This solution, named Erratum, implements a holistic approach
to reduce the element search space, which greatly eases the locator repair task and drastically improves
repair accuracy.
{{design}}
We compare the robustness of Erratum on a large-scale benchmark composed of realistic
and synthetic mutations applied to popular web applications currently deployed in production.
{{method}}
Our empirical
results demonstrate that Erratum outperforms the accuracy of WATER, a state-of-the-art solution, by 67%.
