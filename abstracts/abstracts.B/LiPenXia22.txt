Enjoy your observability: an industrial survey of microservice tracing and analysis.

Microservice systems are often deployed in complex cloud-based environments and may
involve a large number of service instances being dynamically created and destroyed.
{{background}}
It
is thus essential to ensure observability to understand these microservice systemsâ€™ behaviors and troubleshoot their problems.
{{background}}
As an important means to achieve the observability,
distributed tracing and analysis is known to be challenging.
{{background}}
While many companies have
started implementing distributed tracing and analysis for microservice systems, it is not clear
whether existing approaches fulfill the required observability.
{{gap}}
In this article, we present our
industrial survey on microservice tracing and analysis through interviewing developers and
operation engineers of microservice systems from ten companies.
{{objective,method}}
Our survey results offer
a number of findings.
{{a-result}}
For example, large microservice systems commonly adopt a tracing
and analysis pipeline, and the implementations of the pipeline in different companies reflect
different tradeoffs among a variety of concerns.
{{result}}
Visualization and statistic-based metrics are
the most common means for trace analysis, while more advanced analysis techniques such
as machine learning and data mining are seldom used.
{{result:i2}}
Microservice tracing and analysis
is a new big data problem for software engineering, and its practices breed new challenges
and opportunities.
