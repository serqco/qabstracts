Path context augmented statement and network for learning programs.

Applying machine learning techniques in program analysis has attracted much attention.
{{background}}
Recent research efforts in detecting code clones and classifying code have shown that neural models based on abstract syntax trees (ASTs) can better represent source code than
other approaches.
{{background}}
However, existing AST-based approaches do not take into account contextual information of a program, like statement context.
{{gap}}
To address this issue, we propose
a novel approach path context to capture the context of statements, and a path context augmented network (PCAN) to learn a program.
{{objective}}
We evaluate PCAN on code clone detection,
source code classification, and method naming.
{{method}}
The results show that compared to state-ofthe-art approaches, PCAN performs the best on code clone detection and has comparable
performance on code classification and method naming.
