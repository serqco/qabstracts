Empirically developed framework for building trust in distributed agile teams.

Background:
{{h-background}}
Organizations are adopting agile practices in distributed software development in order to
develop quality software in less time.
{{background}}
Using agile software development in distributed set up has its own
set of challenges pertaining to face to face interactions, collaboration, time zone and cultural differences.
{{background}}
A
strong presence of trust helps to overcome these challenges.
{{background}}
A relatively lesser number of empirical studies on
multidimensional perspective of trust in distributed agile software development has motivated this study.
{{gap}}
Objective:
{{h-objective}}
This study aims to develop a comprehensive framework to build trust in distributed agile teams.
{{objective}}
Method:
{{h-method}}
This study is based on Grounded Theory research methodology which involves 40 agile practitioners
from diverse domains belonging to 19 different software organizations located across seven different countries.
{{method}}
Besides, observations in two different software organizations were also performed to gather data.
{{method}}
Data has been
gathered in the form of semi-structured interviews and field notes.
{{method}}
Result:
{{h-result}}
Qualitative data analysis resulted into five different contributing categories for building trust amongst
distributed agile teams.
{{a-result}}
These categories represent multidimensional perspectives that influence trust building
amongst agile team members working across different parts of the world.

Conclusion:
{{h-conclusion}}
This study culminates into a framework for building trust in distributed agile teams.
{{result}}
The proposed
framework has been developed empirically and has five components that influence trust building.
{{summary}}
These
components are related to working environment, leadership, organizational, personal and socio cultural
perspectives.
{{result}}
The multidimensional perspective of trust was investigated from an agile practitioners view
through their real-life project experiences.
{{summary}}
Organizations and software practitioners may utilize the results
of this study to create a hospitable environment for building trust while practicing agile in a distributed
environment.
