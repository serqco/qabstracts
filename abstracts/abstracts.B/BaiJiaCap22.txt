A three-stage transfer learning framework for multi-source cross-project software defect prediction.

Context:
{{h-background}}
Transfer learning techniques have been proved to be effective in the field of Cross-project defect pre­
diction (CPDP).
{{background}}
However, some questions still remain.
{{gap}}
First, the conditional distribution difference between
source and target projects has not been considered.
{{gap}}
Second, facing multiple source projects, most studies only
rarely consider the issues of source selection and multi-source data utilization; instead, they use all available
projects and merge multi-source data together to obtain one final dataset.
{{gap}}
Objective:
{{h-objective}}
To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a three-stage weighting framework for multi-source
transfer learning (3SW-MSTL) in CPDP.
{{objective}}
In stage 1, a source selection strategy is needed to select a suitable
number of source projects from all available projects.
{{design}}
In stage 2, a transfer technique is applied to minimize
marginal differences.
{{design}}
In stage 3, a multi-source data utilization scheme that uses conditional distribution in­
formation is needed to help guide researchers in the use of multi-source transferred data.
{{design}}
Method:
{{h-method}}
First, we have designed five source selection strategies and four multi-source utilization schemes and
chosen the best one to be used in stage 1 and 3 in 3SW-MSTL by comparing their influences on prediction
performance.
{{design}}
Second, to validate the performance of 3SW-MSTL, we compared it with four multi-source and six
single-source CPDP methods, a baseline within-project defect prediction (WPDP) method, and two unsupervised
methods on the data from 30 widely used open-source projects.
{{method}}
Results:
{{h-result}}
Through experiments, bellwether and weighted vote are separately chosen as a source selection strategy
and a multi-source utilization scheme used in 3SW-MSTL.
{{design}}
And, our results indicate that 3SW-MSTL outperforms
four multi-source, six single-source CPDP methods and two unsupervised methods.
{{result}}
And, 3SW-MSTL is compa­
rable to the WPDP method.
{{result}}
Conclusion:
{{h-conclusion}}
The proposed 3SW-MSTL model is more effective for considering the two issues mentioned before.
