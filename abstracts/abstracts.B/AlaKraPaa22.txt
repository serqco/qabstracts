The journey to technical excellence in agile software development.

Context:
{{h-background}}
Technical excellence is a nebulous term in agile software development.
{{background}}
This vagueness is risky
because it may lead to misunderstandings and to agile implementations that may overlook a key principle
of agile development.
{{gap}}
Objective:
{{h-objective}}
This study investigates how agile practitioners interpret the concept of technical excellence brought
up in Principle 9 of the Agile manifesto.
{{objective}}
Moreover, we investigate how agile practitioners put the concept into
practice and what conditions facilitate putting technical excellence into practice.
{{objective}}
Methods:
{{h-method}}
We conducted semi-structured interviews with twenty agile practitioners, coded the data inductively,
and performed two sessions to validate the emerging findings.
{{method}}
Results:
{{h-result}}
We find that technical excellence is first and foremost a mindset that is underpinned by continuous
attention to sustainable code, continuous learning, and teamwork.
{{result}}
Fostering technical excellence requires the
adoption of design and development practices, such as continuous architecting, and is supported by continuous
learning.
{{result}}
We also identify three enabling conditions for technical excellence:
{{result}}
Leadership support, customer buyin, and psychological safety.
{{result}}
These enablers provide teams with leeway to nurture their pursuit of technical
excellence.
{{result}}
Conclusion:
{{h-conclusion}}
Our findings highlight the key role of people-based strategies in promoting technical excellence
in agile software development.
{{conclusion}}
They show that the attainment of technical excellence does not only involve
technical practices.
{{conclusion}}
On the contrary, it relies on social and organizational support and, most importantly, a
mindset.
