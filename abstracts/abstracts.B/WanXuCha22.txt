Characterizing and Detecting Bugs in WeChat Mini-Programs.

Built on the WeChat social platform, WeChat Mini-Programs are
widely used by more than 400 million users every day.

Consequently,
the reliability of Mini-Programs is particularly crucial.

However,
WeChat Mini-Programs suffer from various bugs related to execu-
tion environment, lifecycle management, asynchronous mechanism,
etc.
{{gap}}
These bugs have seriously affected usersâ€™ experience and caused
serious impacts.
{{gap}}
In this paper, we conduct the first empirical study on 83 WeChat
Mini-Program bugs, and perform an in-depth analysis of their root
causes, impacts and fixes.
{{objective}}
From this study, we obtain many interest-
ing findings that can open up new research directions for combating
WeChat Mini-Program bugs.
{{a-result,a-fposs}}
Based on the bug patterns found in
our study, we further develop WeDetector to detect WeChat Mini-
Program bugs.
{{objective}}
Our evaluation on 25 real-world Mini-Programs
has found 11 previously unknown bugs, and 7 of them have been
confirmed by developers.
