Self-adaptive systems: A systematic literature review across categories and domains.

Context:
{{h-background}}
Championed by IBM's vision of autonomic computing paper in 2003, the autonomic computing
research field has seen increased research activity over the last 20 years.
{{background}}
Several conferences (SEAMS, SASO,
ICAC) and workshops (SISSY) have been established and have contributed to the autonomic computing
knowledge base in search of a new kind of system — a self-adaptive system (SAS).
{{background}}
These systems are
characterized by being context-aware and can act on that awareness.
{{background}}
The actions carried out could be on
the system or on the context (or environment).
{{background}}
The underlying goal of a SAS is the sustained achievement of
its goals despite changes in its environment.
{{background}}
Objective:
{{h-objective}}
Despite a number of literature reviews on specific aspects of SASs ranging from their requirements
to quality attributes, we lack a systematic understanding of the current state of the art.

Method:
{{h-method}}
This paper contributes a systematic literature review into self-adaptive systems using the dblp
computer science bibliography as a database.
{{objective,method}}
We filtered the records systematically in successive steps to
arrive at 293 relevant papers.
{{method}}
Each paper was critically analyzed and categorized into an attribute matrix.
{{method}}
This matrix consisted of five categories, with each category having multiple attributes.
{{method}}
The attributes of each
paper, along with the summary of its contents formed the basis of the literature review that spanned 30 years
(1990–2020).
{{method}}
Results:
{{h-result}}
We characterize the maturation process of the research area from theoretical papers over practical
implementations to more holistic and generic approaches, frameworks, and exemplars, applied to areas such
as networking, web services, and robotics, with much of the recent work focusing on IoT and IaaS.
{{result}}
Conclusion:
{{h-conclusion}}
While there is an ebb and flow of application domains, domains like bio-inspired approaches,
security, and cyber–physical systems showed promise to grow heading into the 2020s.
