An empirical study of issue-link algorithms: which issue-link algorithms should we use?

The accuracy of the SZZ algorithm is pivotal for just-in-time defect prediction because most
prior studies have used the SZZ algorithm to detect defect-inducing commits to construct
and evaluate their defect prediction models.
{{background:u1}}
The SZZ algorithm has two phases to detect
defect-inducing commits:
{{background}}
(1) linking issue reports in an issue-tracking system to possible
defect-fixing commits in a version control system by using an issue-link algorithm (ILA);
and (2) tracing the modifications of defect-fixing commits back to possible defect-inducing
commits.
{{background}}
Researchers and practitioners can address the second phase by using existing solutions such as a tool called cregit.
{{background}}
In contrast, although various ILAs have been proposed
for the first phase, no large-scale studies exist in which such ILAs are evaluated under
the same experimental conditions.
{{gap}}
Hence, we still have no conclusions regarding the bestperforming ILA for the first phase.
{{gap}}
In this paper, we compare 10 ILAs collected from our
systematic literature study with regards to the accuracy of detecting defect-fixing commits.
{{method,-ignorediff}}
In addition, we compare the defect prediction performance of ILAs and their combinations that can detect defect-fixing commits accurately.
{{method,-ignorediff}}
We conducted experiments on five
open-source software projects.
{{method}}
We found that all ILAs and their combinations prevented the
defect prediction model from being affected by missing defect-fixing commits.
{{result}}
In particular, the combination of a natural language text similarity approach, Phantom heuristics, a
random forest approach, and a support vector machine approach is the best way to statistically significantly reduced the absolute differences from the ground-truth defect prediction
performance.
{{result:i1}}
We summarized the guidelines to use ILAs as our recommendations.
