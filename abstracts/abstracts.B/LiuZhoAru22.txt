Automatic Detection of Performance Bugs in Database Systems using Equivalent Queries.


Because modern data-intensive applications rely heavily on database
systems (DBMSs), developers extensively test these systems to elim-
inate bugs that negatively affect functionality.
{{background}}
Besides functional
bugs, however, there is another important class of faults that nega-
tively affect the response time of a DBMS, known as performance
bugs.
{{background}}
Despite their potential impact on end-user experience, perfor-
mance bugs have received considerably less attention than functional
bugs.
{{gap}}
To ﬁll this gap, we present A MOEBA, a technique and tool
for automatically detecting performance bugs in DBMSs.
{{objective}}
The core
idea behind A MOEBA is to construct semantically equivalent query
pairs, run both queries on the DBMS under test, and compare their
response time.
{{design}}
If the queries exhibit signiﬁcantly different response
times, that indicates the possible presence of a performance bug in
the DBMS.
{{design}}
To construct equivalent queries, we propose to use a set
of structure and expression mutation rules especially targeted at un-
covering performance bugs.
{{design}}
We also introduce feedback mechanisms
for improving the effectiveness and efﬁciency of the approach.
{{design}}
We
evaluate A MOEBA on two widely-used DBMSs, namely PostgreSQL
and CockroachDB, with promising results:
{{method}}
A MOEBA has so far dis-
covered 39 potential performance bugs, among which developers
have already conﬁrmed 6 bugs and ﬁxed 5 bugs.
