Data-Driven Loop Bound Learning for Termination Analysis.

Termination is a fundamental liveness property for program verifi-
cation.
{{background}}
A loop bound is an upper bound of the number of loop itera-
tions for a given program.
{{background}}
The existence of a loop bound evidences
the termination of the program.
{{background}}
This paper employs a reinforced
black-box learning approach for termination proving, consisting of
a loop bound learner and a validation checker.
{{objective}}
We present efficient
data-driven algorithms for inferring various kinds of loop bounds,
including simple loop bounds, conjunctive loop bounds, and lexico-
graphic loop bounds.
{{design}}
We also devise an efficient validation checker
by integrating a quick bound checking algorithm and a two-way
data sharing mechanism.
{{design}}
We implemented a prototype tool called
ddlTerm.
{{design}}
Experiments on publicly accessible benchmarks show that
ddlTerm outperforms state-of-the-art termination analysis tools by
solving 13-48% more benchmarks and saving 40-77% solving time.
