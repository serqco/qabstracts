Extracting enhanced artificial intelligence model metadata from software repositories.

While artificial intelligence (AI) models have improved at understanding large-scale data,
understanding AI models themselves at any scale is difficult.
{{}}
For example, even two models that implement the same network architecture may differ in frameworks, datasets, or
even domains.
{{}}
Furthermore, attempting to use either model often requires much manual
effort to understand it.
{{}}
As software engineering and AI development share many of the
same languages and tools, techniques in mining software repositories should enable more
scalable insights into AI models and AI development.
{{}}
However, much of the relevant metadata around models are not easily extractable.
{{}}
This paper (an extension of our MSR 2020
paper) presents a library called AIMMX for AI Model Metadata eXtraction from software
repositories into enhanced metadata that conforms to a flexible metadata schema.
{{}}
We evaluated AIMMX against 7,998 open-source models from three sources:
{{}}
model zoos, arXiv
AI papers, and state-of-the-art AI papers.
{{}}
We also explored how AIMMX can enable studies and tools to advance engineering support for AI development.
{{}}
As preliminary examples,
we present an exploratory analysis for data and method reproducibility over the models in
the evaluation dataset and a catalog tool for discovering and managing models.
{{}}
We also
demonstrate the flexibility of extracted metadata by using the evaluation dataset in an existing natural language processing (NLP) analysis platform to identify trends in the dataset.
{{}}
Overall, we hope AIMMX fosters research towards better AI development.
