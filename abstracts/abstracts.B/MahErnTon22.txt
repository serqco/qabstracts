Conclusion stability for natural language based mining of design discussions.

Developer discussions range from in-person hallway chats to comment chains on bug
reports.
{{}}
Being able to identify discussions that touch on software design would be helpful
in documentation and refactoring software.
{{}}
Design mining is the application of machine
learning techniques to correctly label a given discussion artifact, such as a pull request, as
pertaining (or not) to design.
{{}}
In this paper we demonstrate a simple example of how design
mining works.
{{}}
We then show how conclusion stability is poor on different artifact types
and different projects.
{{}}
We show two techniques—augmentation and context specificity—
that greatly improve the conclusion stability and cross-project relevance of design mining.
{{}}
Our new approach achieves AUC of 0.88 on within dataset classification and 0.80 on the
cross-dataset classification task.
