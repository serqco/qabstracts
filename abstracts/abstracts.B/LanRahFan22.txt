Model Transformation Development Using Automated Requirements Analysis, Metamodel Matching, and Transformation by Example.


In this article, we address how the production of model transformations (MT) can be accelerated by automation of transformation synthesis from requirements, examples, and metamodels.
{{}}
We introduce a synthesis
process based on metamodel matching, correspondence patterns between metamodels, and completeness and
consistency analysis of matches.
{{}}
We describe how the limitations of metamodel matching can be addressed by
combining matching with automated requirements analysis and model transformation by example (MTBE)
techniques.
{{}}
We show that in practical examples a large percentage of required transformation functionality can usually
be constructed automatically, thus potentially reducing development effort.
{{}}
We also evaluate the efficiency
of synthesised transformations.
{{}}
Our novel contributions are:
{{}}
• The concept of correspondence patterns between metamodels of a transformation.
{{}}
• Requirements analysis of transformations using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML).
{{}}
• Symbolic MTBE using “predictive specification” to infer transformations from examples.
{{}}
• Transformation generation in multiple MT languages and in Java, from an abstract intermediate
language.
