Measuring and Modeling Group Dynamics in Open-Source Software Development: A Tensor Decomposition Approach.


Many open-source software projects depend on a few core developers, who take over both the bulk of coordination and programming tasks.
{{}}
They are supported by peripheral developers, who contribute either via
discussions or programming tasks, often for a limited time.
{{}}
It is unclear what role these peripheral developers play in the programming and communication efforts, as well as the temporary task-related sub-groups
in the projects.
{{}}
We mine code-repository data and mailing-list discussions to model the relationships and
contributions of developers in a social network and devise a method to analyze the temporal collaboration
structures in communication and programming, learning about the strength and stability of social sub-groups
in open-source software projects.
{{}}
Our method uses multi-modal social networks on a series of time windows.
{{}}
Previous work has reduced the network structure representing developer collaboration to networks with
only one type of interaction, which impedes the simultaneous analysis of more than one type of interaction.
{{}}
We use both communication and version-control data of open-source software projects and model different
types of interaction over time.
{{}}
To demonstrate the practicability of our measurement and analysis method,
we investigate 10 substantial and popular open-source software projects and show that, if sub-groups evolve,
modeling these sub-groups helps predict the future evolution of interaction levels of programmers and groups
of developers.
{{}}
Our method allows maintainers and other stakeholders of open-source software projects to assess instabilities and organizational changes in developer interaction and can be applied to different use cases
in organizational analysis, such as understanding the dynamics of a specific incident or discussion.
