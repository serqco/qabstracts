Improving microservices extraction using evolutionary search.

Context:
{{h-background}}
Microservices constitute a modern style of building software applications as collections of small,
cohesive, and loosely coupled services, i.e., modules, that are developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
{{background}}
Objective:
{{h-objective}}
The migration from legacy systems towards the microservice-based architecture is not a trivial
task.
{{background}}
It is still manual, time-consuming, error-prone and subsequently costly.
{{background}}
The most critical and challenging
issue is the cost-effective identification of microservices boundaries that ensure adequate granularity and
cohesiveness.
{{gap}}
Method:
{{h-method}}
To address this problem, we introduce in this paper a novel approach, named MSExtractor, that
formulates microservices identification as a multi-objective optimization problem.
{{objective}}
The proposed solution aims
at decomposing a legacy application into a set of cohesive, loosely-coupled and coarse-grained services.
{{objective}}
We employ the Indicator-Based Evolutionary Algorithm (IBEA) to drive a search process towards optimal
microservices identification while considering structural and semantic dependencies in the source code.
{{design}}
Results:
{{h-result}}
We conduct an empirical evaluation on a benchmark of seven software systems to assess the efficiency
of our approach.
{{method}}
Results show that MSExtractor is able to carry out an effective identification of relevant
microservice candidates and outperforms three other existing approaches.
{{result:i2}}
Conclusion:
{{h-conclusion}}
In this paper, we show that MSExtractor is able to extract cohesive and loosely coupled services
with higher performance than three other considered methods.
{{summary}}
However, we advocate that while automated
microservices identification approaches are very helpful, the role of the human experts remains crucial to
validate and calibrate the extracted microservices.
