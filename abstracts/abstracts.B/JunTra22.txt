Consolidating a common perspective on Technical Debt and its Management through a Tertiary Study.

Context:
{{h-background}}
Technical Debt (TD) contextualizes the technical decisions on shortcuts and workarounds during software
development, positively and negatively influencing software evolution.
{{background}}
However, TD still seems to confound
with any issue occurring during software development, impacting its proper understanding and management in
software projects.
{{gap}}
Goal:
{{h-objective}}
To synthesize evidence regarding the conceptualization, characteristics, and management of TD in software
projects.
{{objective}}
Method:
{{h-method}}
To undertake a tertiary study to strengthen the knowledge of TD using the principles of Grounded
Theory to support qualitative analysis.
{{method}}
Results:
{{h-result}}
Nineteen secondary studies provide evidence on TD and its management.
{{result}}
They provided information
regarding the TD’s understanding (definitions and characteristics) and management (actions and technologies).
{{result}}
Some causes, such as project constraints, technical decisions, and team members, promote different types of TD
in software projects.
{{result}}
The secondary studies also supported identifying the impacts of TD regarding project
management, team members, the organization’s business, and internal software quality.
{{a-result}}
Besides helping identify
TD challenges, such studies contributed to integrating a conjectured conceptual model of TD that can support
future discussions and investigations regarding TD’s understanding and management.
{{a-result}}
Conclusions:
{{h-conclusion}}
The set of evidence regarding TD’s understanding, actions, and technologies to manage TD can aid
software practitioners in their software projects.
{{conclusion}}
However, it is observable an interpretation overload regarding
its definition, inducing to classify any issue occurring during the software development as TD.
{{conclusion}}
Therefore, further
discussions and investigations still represent essential steps towards consolidating a common perspective on TD
and its management.
