DrAsync: Identifying and Visualizing Anti-Patterns in Asynchronous JavaScript.

Promises and async/await have become popular mechanisms for
implementing asynchronous computations in JavaScript, but de-
spite their popularity, programmers have difficulty using them.
{{background,gap}}
This paper identifies 8 anti-patterns in promise-based JavaScript
code that are prevalent across popular JavaScript repositories.
{{result}}
We
present a light-weight static analysis for automatically detecting
these anti-patterns.
{{objective}}
This analysis is embedded in an interactive
visualization tool that additionally relies on dynamic analysis to
visualize promise lifetimes and instances of anti-patterns executed
at run time.
{{design}}
By enabling the user to navigate between promises in
the visualization and the source code fragments that they originate
from, problems and optimization opportunities can be identified.
{{design,claim}}
We implement this approach in a tool called DrAsync, and found
2.6K static instances of anti-patterns in 20 popular JavaScript repos-
itories.
{{method,result}}
Upon examination of a subset of these, we found that the
majority of problematic code reported by DrAsync could be elimi-
nated through refactoring.
{{result:i1}}
Further investigation revealed that, in a
few cases, the elimination of anti-patterns reduced the time needed
to execute the refactored code fragments.
{{result:i1}}
Moreover, DrAsync's visu-
alization of promise lifetimes and relationships provides additional
insight into the execution behavior of asynchronous programs and
helped identify further optimization opportunities.
