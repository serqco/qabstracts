How Do Successful and Failed Projects Differ? A Socio-Technical Analysis.


Software development is at the intersection of the social realm, involving people who develop the software,
and the technical realm, involving artifacts (code, docs, etc.) that are being produced.
{{}}
It has been shown that
a socio-technical perspective provides rich information about the state of a software project.
{{}}
In particular, we are interested in socio-technical factors that are associated with project success.
{{}}
For this
purpose, we frame the task as a network classification problem.
{{}}
We show how a set of heterogeneous networks composed of social and technical entities can be jointly embedded in a single vector space enabling
mathematically sound comparisons between distinct software projects.
{{}}
Our approach is specifically designed
using intuitive metrics stemming from network analysis and statistics to ease the interpretation of results
in the context of software engineering wisdom.
{{}}
Based on a selection of 32 open source projects, we perform
an empirical study to validate our approach considering three prediction scenarios to test the classification
model's ability generalizing to (1) randomly held-out project snapshots, (2) future project states, and (3) entirely new projects.
{{}}
Our results provide evidence that a socio-technical perspective is superior to a pure social or technical
perspective when it comes to early indicators of future project success.
{{}}
To our surprise, the methodology
proposed here even shows evidence of being able to generalize to entirely novel (project hold-out set) software
projects reaching predication accuracies of 80%, which is a further testament to the efficacy of our approach
and beyond what has been possible so far.
{{}}
In addition, we identify key features that are strongly associated
with project success.
{{}}
Our results indicate that even relatively simple socio-technical networks capture highly
relevant and interpretable information about the early indicators of future project success.
