On the impact of security vulnerabilities in the npm and RubyGems dependency networks.

The increasing interest in open source software has led to the emergence of large languagespecific package distributions of reusable software libraries, such as npm and RubyGems.
{{background}}
These software packages can be subject to vulnerabilities that may expose dependent packages through explicitly declared dependencies.
{{background}}
Using Snykâ€™s vulnerability database, this
article empirically studies vulnerabilities affecting npm and RubyGems packages.
{{objective}}
We analyse how and when these vulnerabilities are disclosed and fixed, and how their prevalence
changes over time.
{{a-result}}
We also analyse how vulnerable packages expose their direct and indirect
dependents to vulnerabilities.
{{a-result}}
We distinguish between two types of dependents:
{{method}}
packages
distributed via the package manager, and external GitHub projects depending on npm packages.
{{method}}
We observe that the number of vulnerabilities in npm is increasing and being disclosed
faster than vulnerabilities in RubyGems.
{{result}}
For both package distributions, the time required
to disclose vulnerabilities is increasing over time.
{{result}}
Vulnerabilities in npm packages affect a
median of 30 package releases, while this is 59 releases in RubyGems packages.
{{result}}
A large
proportion of external GitHub projects is exposed to vulnerabilities coming from direct or
indirect dependencies.
{{result:i1}}
33% and 40% of dependency vulnerabilities to which projects and
packages are exposed, respectively, have their fixes in more recent releases within the same
major release range of the used dependency.
{{result}}
Our findings reveal that more effort is needed
to better secure open source package distributions.
