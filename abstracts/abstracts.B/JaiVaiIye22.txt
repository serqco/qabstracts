Jigsaw: Large Language Models meet Program Synthesis.

Large pre-trained language models such as GPT-3 [10], Codex [11],
and Google's language model [7] are now capable of generating
code from natural language specifications of programmer intent.
{{background}}
We view these developments with a mixture of optimism and cau-
tion.
{{background}}
On the optimistic side, such large language models have the
potential to improve productivity by providing an automated AI
pair programmer for every programmer in the world.
{{background}}
On the cau-
tionary side, since these large language models do not understand
program semantics, they offer no guarantees about quality of the
suggested code.
{{gap}}
In this paper, we present an approach to augment
these large language models with post-processing steps based on
program analysis and synthesis techniques, that understand the
syntax and semantics of programs.

Further, we show that such tech-
niques can make use of user feedback and improve with usage.
{{objective}}
We
present our experiences from building and evaluating such a tool
Jigsaw, targeted at synthesizing code for using Python Pandas API
using multi-modal inputs.
{{a-design,a-result}}
Our experience suggests that as these
large language models evolve for synthesizing code from intent,
Jigsaw has an important role to play in improving the accuracy of
the systems.
