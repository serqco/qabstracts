DiffTech: Differencing Similar Technologies From Crowd-Scale Comparison Discussions.

Developers use different technologies for many software development tasks.
{{}}
However, when faced with several
technologies with comparable functionalities, it is not easy to select the most appropriate one, as trial and error comparisons among
such technologies are time-consuming.
{{}}
Instead, developers can resort to expert articles, read official documents or ask questions in
Q&A sites.
{{}}
However, it still remains difficult to get a comprehensive comparison as online information is often fragmented or
contradictory.
{{}}
To overcome these limitations, we propose the DIFFTECH system that exploits crowdsourced discussions from Stack
Overflow, and assists technology comparison with an informative summary of different aspects.
{{}}
We first build a large database of
comparable technologies in software engineering by mining tags in Stack Overflow.
{{}}
We then locate comparative sentences about
comparable technologies with natural language processing methods.
{{}}
We further mine prominent comparison aspects by clustering
similar comparative sentences and representing each cluster with its keywords and aggregate the overall opinion towards the
comparable technologies.
{{}}
Our evaluation demonstrates both the accuracy and usefulness of our model, and we have implemented our
approach as a practical website for public use.
