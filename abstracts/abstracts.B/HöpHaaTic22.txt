Advantages and disadvantages of (dedicated) model transformation languages.

Context
{{h-background}}
Model driven development envisages the use of model transformations to evolve
models.
{{background}}
Model transformation languages, developed for this task, are touted with many
benefits over general purpose programming languages.
{{background}}
However, a large number of these
claims have not yet been substantiated.
{{gap}}
They are also made without the context necessary
to be able to critically assess their merit or built meaningful empirical studies around them.
{{gap}}
Objective
{{h-objective}}
The objective of our work is to elicit the reasoning, influences and background
knowledge that lead people to assume benefits or drawbacks of model transformation
languages.
{{objective}}
Method
{{h-method}}
We conducted a large-scale interview study involving 56 participants from research
and industry.
{{method}}
Interviewees were presented with claims about model transformation languages and were asked to provide reasons for their assessment thereof.
{{method}}
We qualitatively
analysed the responses to find factors that influence the properties of model transformation
languages as well as explanations as to how exactly they do so.
{{method}}
Results
{{h-result}}
Our interviews show, that general purpose expressiveness of GPLs, domain specific
capabilities of MTLs as well as tooling all have strong influences on how people view
properties of model transformation languages.
{{result:u2}}
Moreover, the Choice of MTL, the Use Case
for which a transformation should be developed as well as the Skills of involved stakeholders
have a moderating effect on the influences, by changing the context to consider.
{{result}}
Conclusion
{{h-conclusion}}
There is a broad body of experience, that suggests positive and negative influences for properties of MTLs.
{{summary}}
Our data suggests, that much needs to be done in order to
convey the viability of model transformation languages.
{{fneed}}
Efforts to provide more empirical
substance need to be undergone and lacklustre language capabilities and tooling need to be
improved upon.
{{fneed}}
We suggest several approaches for this that can be based on the results of
the presented study.
