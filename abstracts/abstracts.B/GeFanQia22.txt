Locality-based security bug report identification via active learning.

Context:
{{}}
Security bug report (SBR) identification is a crucial way to eliminate security-critical vulnerabilities
during software development.
{{}}
Objective:
{{}}
In recent years, many approaches have utilized supervised machine learning (SML) techniques in
the SBR identification.
{{}}
However, such approaches often require a large number of labelled bug reports, which
are often hard to obtain in practice.
{{}}
Active learning is a potential approach to reducing the manual labelling
cost while maintaining good performance.
{{}}
Nevertheless, the existing active learning-based SBR identification
approach still yields poor performance due to ignoring the locality in bug reports.
{{}}
Method:
{{}}
To address the above problems, we propose locality-based SBR identification via active learning.
{{}}
Our approach recommends a small part of instances based on locality in bug reports, asks for their labels, and
learns the SBR classifier.
{{}}
Specifically, our approach relies on the locality to construct the initial training set,
which is designed to address how to start during active learning.
{{}}
Moreover, our approach applies the locality
into the query process, which is designed to improve which instance should be queried next during active
learning.
{{}}
Result:
{{}}
We conduct experiments on large-scale bug reports (nearly 125K) from six real-world projects.
{{}}
In
comparison with three state-of-the-art SML-based and active learning-based SBR identification approaches, our
approach can obtain the maximum values of F-Measure (0.8176) and AUC (0.8631).
{{}}
Moreover, our approach
requires 16.60% to 71.40% of all bug reports when achieving the optimal performance in these six projects,
which improves three approaches from 9.82% to 64.19% on average.
{{}}
Conclusion:
{{}}
As shown from the experimental results, our approach can be more effective and efficient to
identify SBRs than the existing approaches.
