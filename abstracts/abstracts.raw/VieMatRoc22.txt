The role of bug report evolution in reliable fixing estimation.

Context Bug reports contain information that can be used by researchers and practitioners
to better understand the bug fixing process and to enable the estimation of the effort necessary to fix bugs.
{{}}
In general, estimation models are built using the data (e.g., fixing time,
severity, number of comments, number of attachments, and number of patches) present in
the reports of fixed bugs (i.e., the report final’s state).
{{}}
However, we claim that this approach
is not reliable in a real setting.
{{}}
Effort estimation is necessary for bug fix scheduling and
team allocation tasks, which happens closer to the bug report opening than its closing.
{{}}
At
that moment, the data available in the bug report is less informative than the data used to
build the model, which may lead to an unrealistic estimation.
{{}}
Objective We propose a new approach to estimate bug-fixing time, i.e., the time span
between the moment the bug was first reported until the bug is considered fixed.
{{}}
We consider not only the final state of the bug report to create our estimation model but all the
previous available states, different from some previous studies that do not consider the
reports’ updates.
{{}}
The concept of bug report evolution is used to create a dataset containing
all investigated report states.
{{}}
Method First, we verify how often the bug reports and their fields are updated.
{{}}
Next, we
evaluate our approach using different machine learning methods as a classification problem, with distinct output configurations, and class balancing techniques.
{{}}
The experimental
analysis is performed with data from the JIRA issue tracking system of ten open-source
projects.
{{}}
By leveraging the best models (considering all possible configurations) for the different states of the evolution of a bug report, we can assess whether there are significant
differences in the models’ estimation ability due to the report’s state.
{{}}
Results We gathered evidence that the reports’ fields are updated often, which characterizes
the reports’ evolution, impacting the building of bug-fixing estimation models.
