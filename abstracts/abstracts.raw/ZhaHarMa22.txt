Machine Learning Testing: Survey, Landscapes and Horizons.

This paper provides a comprehensive survey of techniques for testing machine learning systems; Machine Learning
Testing (ML testing) research.
{{}}
It covers 144 papers on testing properties (e.g., correctness, robustness, and fairness), testing
components (e.g., the data, learning program, and framework), testing workflow (e.g., test generation and test evaluation), and
application scenarios (e.g., autonomous driving, machine translation).

The paper also analyses trends concerning datasets, research
trends, and research focus, concluding with research challenges and promising research directions in ML testing.
