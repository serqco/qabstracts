An empirical study on release notes patterns of popular apps in the Google Play Store.

Release notes of a new mobile release provide valuable information for app users about
the updated functionality of an app.
{{}}
Moreover, app developers can use the release notes
to inform users about the resolution of a previously reported issue in user reviews.
{{}}
Prior
work shows that release notes are an essential artifact for app developers to announce the
emergency fixes and the newly adopted features.
{{}}
However, little is known about the common
practices adapted by app developers in preparing their release notes.
{{}}
In this paper, we are
interested in capturing the common practices as release notes patterns.
{{}}
First, we conduct an
online survey with 102 respondents to investigate their views on mobile release notes.
{{}}
Our
results show that most developers find release notes to be useful for notifying their userbase.
{{}}
Then, we study release notes patterns by analyzing 69,851 releases and 67.7 million
user reviews of 2,232 top free-to-download apps in the Google Play Store over three years
(from April 2016 until April 2019).
{{}}
We observe that app developers tend to write either
long release notes (over 50 words) or short release notes (less than 7 words).
{{}}
We use the
characteristics of release notes, such as the number of words, to identify six patterns of
release notes in mobile apps.
{{}}
We manually investigate the release notes from each of the
six patterns, and find 17 release drivers for the release notes.
{{}}
We also find that apps with
longer release notes tend to have higher average user ratings.
{{}}
Furthermore, we observe that a
shift from rarely updated patterns to frequently updated patterns tend to have higher average
user ratings.
{{}}
Our work shows potential directions for developers to improve the release note
mechanisms in app stores.
