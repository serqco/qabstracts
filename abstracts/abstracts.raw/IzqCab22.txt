On the analysis of non-coding roles in open source development.

The role of non-coding contributors in Open Source Software (OSS) is poorly understood.
{{}}
Most of current research around OSS development focuses on the coding aspects of the
project (e.g., commits, pull requests or code reviews) while ignoring the potential of other
types of contributions.
{{}}
Often, due to the assumption that these other contributions are not
significant in number and that, in any case, they are handled by the same people that are also
part of the “coding team”.
{{}}
This paper aims to investigate whether this is actually the case
by analyzing the frequency and diversity of non-coding contributions in OSS development.
{{}}
As a sample of projects for our study we have taken the 100 most popular projects in the
ecosystem of NPM, a package manager for JavaScript.
{{}}
Our results validate the importance
of dedicated non-coding contributors in OSS and the diversity of OSS communities as,
typically, a contributor specializes in a specific subset of roles.
{{}}
We foresee that projects
adopting explicit policies to attract and onboard them could see a positive impact in their
long-term sustainability providing they also put in place the right governance strategies to
facilitate the migration and collaboration among the different roles.
{{}}
As part of this work, we
also provide a replicability package to facilitate further quantitative role-based analysis by
other researchers.
