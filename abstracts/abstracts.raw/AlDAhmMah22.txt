An end-to-end deep learning system for requirements classification using recurrent neural networks.

Context:
{{}}
Existing requirements classification approaches mainly use lexical and syntactical features to classify
requirements using both traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches with promising results.
{{}}
However, the existing techniques depend on word and sentence structures and employ preprocessing and
feature engineering techniques to classify requirements from textual natural language documents.
{{}}
Moreover,
existing studies deal with requirements classification as binary or multiclass classification problems and not
as multilabel classification, although a given requirement can belong to multiple classes at the same time.
{{}}
Objective:
{{}}
The objective of this study is to classify requirements into functional and different non-functional
types with minimal preprocessing and to model the task as a multilabel classification problem.
{{}}
Method:
{{}}
In this paper, we use Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Neural Networks (BiGRU) to classify requirements
using raw text.
{{}}
We investigated two different approaches:
{{}}
(i) using word sequences as tokens and (ii) using
character sequences as tokens.
{{}}
Results:
{{}}
Experiments conducted on the publicly available PROMISE and EHR datasets show the effectiveness
of the presented techniques.
{{}}
We achieve state-of-the-art results on most of the tasks using word sequences as
tokens.
{{}}
Conclusion:
{{}}
Requirements can be effectively classified into functional and different non-functional categories
using the presented recurrent neural networks-based deep learning system, which involves minimal text
prepossessing and no feature engineering.
