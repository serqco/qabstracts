Comparing Block-Based Programming Models for Two-Armed Robots.

Modern industrial robots can work alongside human workers and coordinate with other robots.
{{}}
This means they can
perform complex tasks, but doing so requires complex programming.
{{}}
Therefore, robots are typically programmed by experts, but there
are not enough to meet the growing demand for robots.
{{}}
To reduce the need for experts, researchers have tried to make robot
programming accessible to factory workers without programming experience.
{{}}
However, none of that previous work supports
coordinating multiple robot arms that work on the same task.
{{}}
In this paper we present four block-based programming language designs
that enable end-users to program two-armed robots.
{{}}
We analyze the benefits and trade-offs of each design on expressiveness and
user cognition, and evaluate the designs based on a survey of 273 professional participants of whom 110 had no previous
programming experience.
{{}}
We further present an interactive experiment based on a prototype implementation of the design we deem
best.
{{}}
This experiment confirmed that novices can successfully use our prototype to complete realistic robotics tasks.
{{}}
This work
contributes to making coordinated programming of robots accessible to end-users.
{{}}
It further explores how visual programming
elements can make traditionally challenging programming tasks more beginner-friendly.
