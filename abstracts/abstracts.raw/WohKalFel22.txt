Successful combination of database search and snowballing for identification of primary studies in systematic literature studies.

Background:
{{}}
A good search strategy is essential for a successful systematic literature study.
{{}}
Historically,
database searches have been the norm, which was later complemented with snowball searches.
{{}}
Our conjecture
is that we can perform even better searches if combining these two search approaches, referred to as a hybrid
search strategy.
{{}}
Objective:
{{}}
Our main objective was to compare and evaluate a hybrid search strategy.
{{}}
Furthermore, we
compared four alternative hybrid search strategies to assess whether we could identify more cost-efficient
ways of searching for relevant primary studies.
{{}}
Methods:
{{}}
To compare and evaluate the hybrid search strategy, we replicated the search procedure in a
systematic literature review (SLR) on industry–academia collaboration in software engineering.
{{}}
The SLR used
a more ‘‘traditional’’ approach to searching for relevant articles for an SLR, while our replication was executed
using a hybrid search strategy.
{{}}
Results:
{{}}
In our evaluation, the hybrid search strategy was superior in identifying relevant primary studies.
{{}}
It
identified 30% more primary studies and even more studies when focusing only on peer-reviewed articles.
{{}}
To
embrace individual viewpoints when assessing research articles and minimise the risk of missing primary
studies, we introduced two new concepts, wild cards and borderline articles, when performing systematic
literature studies.
{{}}
Conclusions:
{{}}
The hybrid search strategy is a strong contender for being used when performing systematic
literature studies.
{{}}
Furthermore, alternative hybrid search strategies may be viable if selected wisely in relation
to the start set for snowballing.
{{}}
Finally, the two new concepts were judged as essential to cater for different
individual judgements and to minimise the risk of excluding primary studies that ought to be included.
