DevRec: Multi-Relationship Embedded Software Developer Recommendation.

Collaboration efficiency is of paramount importance for software development.
{{}}
Finding suitable developers is critical and
challenging due to the difficulty of capturing developers’ expertises, relevance as well as the sparsity of explicit developer-task
interactions.
{{}}
To tackle this problem, existing developer recommendation approaches focus on modelling the developer’s expertise or
interactions with tasks based on their historical information.
{{}}
However, such approaches often suffer from low performance because
they ignore some useful information that might help improve recommendation performance, such as 1) developers’ collaboration
relationship; 2) the interaction relationship between developer and task; and 3) the tasks’ similarity relationship.
{{}}
To leverage the
above-mentioned relationships, this paper proposes DevRec, a novel multi-relationship embedded approach for software developer
recommendation.
{{}}
We first formally define the multi-relationships and then learn the vector representations (aka.
{{}}
embeddings) of
developers and tasks.
{{}}
Second, we explicitly encoded the multi-relationships into the embedding process.
{{}}
Third, to refine the
embeddings of developers and tasks, we recursively propagate the embeddings from their high-order connectivity based on graph
convolution network.
{{}}
Moreover, to reveal the importance of different relationships, we generate their attentive weights based on
attention mechanism.
{{}}
Finally, to evaluate the performance of DevRec, we conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets,
and to investigate the usefulness of DevRec in practice, we conduct a user study at a large software company.
{{}}
The results show that
DevRec outperforms other five state-of-the-art approaches significantly.
