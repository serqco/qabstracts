Managing Episodic Volunteers in Free/Libre/Open Source Software Communities.

We draw on the concept of episodic volunteering (EV) from the general volunteering literature to identify practices for
managing EV in free/libre/open source software (FLOSS) communities.
{{}}
Infrequent but ongoing participation is widespread, but the
practices that community managers are using to manage EV, and their concerns about EV, have not been previously documented.
{{}}
We
conducted a policy Delphi study involving 24 FLOSS community managers from 22 different communities.
{{}}
Our panel identified 16
concerns related to managing EV in FLOSS, which we ranked by prevalence.
{{}}
We also describe 65 practices for managing EV in
FLOSS.
{{}}
Almost three-quarters of these practices are used by at least three community managers.
{{}}
We report these practices using a
systematic presentation that includes context, relationships between practices, and concerns that they address.
{{}}
These findings provide
a coherent framework that can help FLOSS community managers to better manage episodic contributors.
