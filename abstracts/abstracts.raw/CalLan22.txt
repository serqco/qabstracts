Assessing the personality of software engineers may help to match individual traits with the characteristics
of development activities such as code review and testing, as well as support managers in team composition.
{{}}
However, self-assessment questionnaires are not a practical solution for collecting multiple observations on a
large scale.
{{}}
Instead, automatic personality detection, while overcoming these limitations, is based on off-theshelf solutions trained on non-technical corpora, which might not be readily applicable to technical domains
like software engineering.
{{}}
In this article, we first assess the performance of general-purpose personality detection tools when applied to a technical corpus of developers’ e-mails retrieved from the public archives of the
Apache Software Foundation.
{{}}
We observe a general low accuracy of predictions and an overall disagreement
among the tools.
{{}}
Second, we replicate two previous research studies in software engineering by replacing the
personality detection tool used to infer developers’ personalities from pull-request discussions and e-mails.
{{}}
We observe that the original results are not confirmed, i.e., changing the tool used in the original study leads
to diverging conclusions.
{{}}
Our results suggest a need for personality detection tools specially targeted for the
software engineering domain.
