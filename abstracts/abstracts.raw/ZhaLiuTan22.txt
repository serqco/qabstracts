To achieve commercial goals, companies have made substantial contributions to large open-source software
(OSS) ecosystems such as OpenStack and have become the main contributors.
{{}}
However, they often withdraw their employees for a variety of reasons, which may affect the sustainability of OSS projects.
{{}}
While the
turnover of individual contributors has been extensively investigated, there is a lack of knowledge about the
nature of companies’ withdrawal.
{{}}
To this end, we conduct a mixed-methods empirical study on OpenStack to
reveal how common company withdrawals were, to what degree withdrawn companies made contributions,
and what the rationale behind withdrawals was.
{{}}
By analyzing the commit data of 18 versions of OpenStack,
we find that the number of companies that have left is increasing and even surpasses the number of companies that have joined in later versions.
{{}}
Approximately 12% of the companies in each version have exited
by the next version.
{{}}
Compared to the sustaining companies that joined in the same version, the withdrawn
companies tend to have a weaker contribution intensity but contribute to a similar scope of repositories in
OpenStack.
{{}}
Through conducting a developer survey, we find four aspects of reasons for companies’ withdrawal from OpenStack:
{{}}
company, community, developer, and project.
{{}}
The most common reasons lie in the
company aspect, i.e., the company either achieved its goals or failed to do so.
{{}}
By fitting the survival analysis
model, we find that commercial goals are associated with the probability of the company’s withdrawal, and
that a company’s contribution intensity and scale are positively correlated with its retention.
{{}}
Maintaining
good retention is important but challenging for OSS ecosystems, and our results may shed light on potential
approaches to improve company retention and reduce the negative impact of company withdrawal.
