A Hybrid Distributed EA Approach for Energy Optimisation on Smartphones.

For many people, mobile platforms are now an essential part of everyday life.
{{}}
A defining
feature of mobile platforms is their reliance on battery performance.
{{}}
Due to this reliance,
there is a pressing need for mobile applications that minimise their own impact on batteries.
{{}}
While mobile platforms are improving their capabilities in terms of policing the energy
use of applications and rationing energy-hungry devices, mobile application developers still
lack knowledge in how to write energy efficient programs.
{{}}
Recent work in automatic program improvement using heuristic search over randomly generated program variants has
shown some promise in terms of producing reductions in programs’ energy-use.
{{}}
A challenge
in this work is accurately measuring the energy-use of program variants.
{{}}
One approach to
measurement is to use each platform’s internal meter to assess variants on the device itself.
{{}}
This approach has advantages in terms of measuring actual energy-use on each platform but
is not ideal for the search for program variants that perform well across multiple platforms.
{{}}
The work in this paper addresses this problem by using an island-like evolutionary search
mode to simultaneously evolve variants on multiple platforms.
{{}}
Island models of evolutionary search conduct search on multiple platforms in parallel and share promising variants.
{{}}
The results show that this approach has advantages over isolated evolution in terms of speeding up evolution on each platform and improving the efficiency of search.
{{}}
Validation results
show that the island-inspired model is able to evolve variants with good cross-platform performance.
{{}}
In addition, it evolves a solution that outperforms best found solutions using a
sequential evolutionary algorithm on it is native platform with an effect size greater than
90%.
