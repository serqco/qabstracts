Android Custom Permissions Demystified: A Comprehensive Security Evaluation.

Permission is the fundamental security mechanism for protecting user data and privacy on Android.
{{}}
Given its importance,
security researchers have studied the design and usage of permissions from various aspects.
{{}}
However, most of the previous research
focused on the security issues of system permissions.
{{}}
Overlooked by many researchers, an app can use custom permissions to share
its resources and capabilities with other apps.
{{}}
However, the security implications of using custom permissions have not been fully
understood.
{{}}
In this paper, we systematically evaluate the design and implementation of Android custom permissions.
{{}}
Notably, we built
an automatic fuzzing tool, called CuPerFuzzer+, to detect custom permission related vulnerabilities existing in the Android OS.
{{}}
CuPerFuzzer+ treats the operations of the permission mechanism as a black-box and executes massive targeted test cases to trigger
privilege escalation.
{{}}
In the experiments, CuPerFuzzer+ discovered 5,932 effective cases with 47 critical paths successfully.
{{}}
Through
investigating these vulnerable cases and analyzing the source code of Android OS, we further identified a series of severe design
shortcomings lying in the Android permission framework, including dangling custom permission, inconsistent permission-group
mapping, custom permission elevating, inconsistent permission definition, dormant permission group, and inconsistent permission
type.
{{}}
Exploiting these shortcomings, a malicious app can access unauthorized platform resources.
{{}}
On top of these observations, we
propose three general design guidelines to secure custom permissions.
{{}}
Our findings have been acknowledged by the Android security
team and assigned CVE-2020-0418, CVE-2021-0306, CVE-2021-0307, and CVE-2021-0317.
