Information leakage can have dramatic consequences on systems security.
{{}}
Among harmful information leaks,
the timing information leakage occurs whenever an attacker successfully deduces confidential internal information.
{{}}
In this work, we consider that the attacker has access (only) to the system execution time.
{{}}
We address
the following timed opacity problem:
{{}}
given a timed system, a private location and a final location, synthesize
the execution times from the initial location to the final location for which one cannot deduce whether the
system went through the private location.
{{}}
We also consider the full timed opacity problem, asking whether
the system is opaque for all execution times.
{{}}
We show that these problems are decidable for timed automata
(TAs) but become undecidable when one adds parameters, yielding parametric timed automata (PTAs).
{{}}
We
identify a subclass with some decidability results.
{{}}
We then devise an algorithm for synthesizing PTAs parameter valuations guaranteeing that the resulting TA is opaque.
{{}}
We finally show that our method can also apply
to program analysis.
