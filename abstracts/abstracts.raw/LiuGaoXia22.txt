Context:
{{}}
Deep learning (DL) techniques have gained significant popularity among software engineering
(SE) researchers in recent years.
{{}}
This is because they can often solve many SE challenges without enormous
manual feature engineering effort and complex domain knowledge.
{{}}
Objective:
{{}}
Although many DL studies have reported substantial advantages over other state-of-the-art models on effectiveness, they often ignore two factors:
{{}}
(1) reproducibility—whether the reported experimental
results can be obtained by other researchers using authors’ artifacts (i.e., source code and datasets) with the
same experimental setup; and (2) replicability—whether the reported experimental result can be obtained
by other researchers using their re-implemented artifacts with a different experimental setup.
{{}}
We observed
that DL studies commonly overlook these two factors and declare them as minor threats or leave them for
future work.
{{}}
This is mainly due to high model complexity with many manually set parameters and the timeconsuming optimization process, unlike classical supervised machine learning (ML) methods (e.g., random
forest).
{{}}
This study aims to investigate the urgency and importance of reproducibility and replicability for DL
studies on SE tasks.
{{}}
Method:
{{}}
In this study, we conducted a literature review on 147 DL studies recently published in 20 SE venues
and 20 AI (Artificial Intelligence) venues to investigate these issues.
{{}}
We also re-ran four representative DL
models in SE to investigate important factors that may strongly affect the reproducibility and replicability of
a study.
