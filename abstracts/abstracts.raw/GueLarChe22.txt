Property Satisfiability Analysis for Product Lines of Modelling Languages.

Software engineering uses models throughout most phases of the development process.
{{}}
Models are defined using modelling
languages.
{{}}
To make these languages applicable to a wider set of scenarios and customizable to specific needs, researchers have
proposed using product lines to specify modelling language variants.
{{}}
However, there is currently a lack of efficient techniques for ensuring
correctness with respect to properties of the models accepted by a set of language variants.
{{}}
This may prevent detecting problematic
combinations of language variants that produce undesired effects at the model level.
{{}}
To attack this problem, we first present a
classification of instantiability properties for language product lines.
{{}}
Then, we propose a novel approach to lifting the satisfiability
checking of model properties of individual language variants, to the product line level.
{{}}
Finally, we report on an implementation of our
proposal in the MERLIN tool, and demonstrate the efficiency gains of our lifted analysis method compared to an enumerative analysis of
each individual language variant.
