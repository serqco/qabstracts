SoftNER: Mining knowledge graphs from cloud incidents.

The move from boxed products to services and the widespread adoption of cloud computing
has had a huge impact on the software development life cycle and DevOps processes.
{{}}
Particularly, incident management has become critical for developing and operating large-scale
services.
{{}}
Prior work on incident management has heavily focused on the challenges with
incident triaging and de-duplication.
{{}}
In this work, we address the fundamental problem of
structured knowledge extraction from service incidents.
{{}}
We have built SoftNER, a framework for mining Knowledge Graphs from incident reports.
{{}}
First, we build a novel multi-task
learning based BiLSTM-CRF model which leverages not just the semantic context but also
the data-types for extracting factual information in the form of named entities.
{{}}
Next, we
present an approach to mine relations between the named entities for automatically constructing knowledge graphs.
{{}}
We have deployed SoftNER at Microsoft, a major cloud service
provider and have evaluated it on more than 2 months of cloud incidents.
{{}}
We show that
SoftNER’s unsupervised pipeline learns the software entity types from unstructured incident data with high precision of 0.96 (at rank 50) and 0.77 (at rank 100).
{{}}
We also evaluate
and show that SoftNER’s unsupervised pipeline accurately labels data with a precision of
0.94.
{{}}
Further, our multi-task learning based deep learning model also outperforms the stateof-the-art NER models with an average F1 of 0.96.
{{}}
Lastly, using the knowledge extracted
by SoftNER, we are able to build accurate models for tasks such as incident triaging and
recommending entities based on their relevance to incident titles.
