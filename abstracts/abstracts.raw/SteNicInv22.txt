Verification of Distributed Systems via Sequential Emulation.


Sequential emulation is a semantics-based technique to automatically reduce property checking of distributed
systems to the analysis of sequential programs.
{{}}
An automated procedure takes as input a formal specification
of a distributed system, a property of interest, and the structural operational semantics of the specification
language and generates a sequential program whose execution traces emulate the possible evolutions of the
considered system.
{{}}
The problem as to whether the property of interest holds for the system can then be
expressed either as a reachability or as a termination query on the program.
{{}}
This allows to immediately
adapt mature verification techniques developed for general-purpose languages to domain-specific languages,
and to effortlessly integrate new techniques as soon as they become available.
{{}}
We test our approach on a
selection of concurrent systems originated from different contexts from population protocols to models of
flocking behaviour.
{{}}
By combining a comprehensive range of program verification techniques, from traditional
symbolic execution to modern inductive-based methods such as property-directed reachability, we are able
to draw consistent and correct verification verdicts for the considered systems.
