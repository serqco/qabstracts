Story points changes in agile iterative development.

Story Points (SP) are an effort unit that is used to represent the relative effort of a work
item.
{{}}
In Agile software development, SP allows a development team to estimate their delivery capacity and facilitate the sprint planning activities.
{{}}
Although Agile embraces changes,
SP changes after the sprint planning may negatively impact the sprint plan.
{{}}
To minimize the
impact, there is a need to better understand the SP changes and an automated approach to
predict the SP changes.
{{}}
Hence, to better understand the SP changes, we examine the prevalence, accuracy, and impact of information changes on SP changes.
{{}}
Through the analyses
based on 19,349 work items spread across seven open-source projects, we find that on average, 10% of the work items have SP changes.
{{}}
These work items typically have SP value
increased by 58%-100% relative to the initial SP value when they were assigned to a sprint.
{{}}
We also find that the unchanged SP reflect the development time better than the changed SP.
{{}}
Our qualitative analysis shows that the work items with changed SP often have the information changes relating to updating the scope of work.
{{}}
Our empirical results suggest that SP
and the scope of work should be reviewed prior or during sprint planning to achieve a reliable sprint plan.
{{}}
Yet, it could be a tedious task to review all work items in the product (or
sprint) backlog.
{{}}
Therefore, we develop a classifier to predict whether a work item will have
SP changes after being assigned to a sprint.
{{}}
Our classifier achieves an AUC of 0.69-0.8,
which is significantly better than the baselines.
{{}}
Our results suggest that to better manage
and prepare for the unreliability in SP estimation, the team can leverage our insights and the
classifier during the sprint planning.
{{}}
To facilitate future studies, we provide the replication
package and the datasets, which are available online.
