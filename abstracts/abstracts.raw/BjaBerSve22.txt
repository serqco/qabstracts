Inter-team communication in large-scale co-located software engineering: a case study.

Large-scale software engineering is a collaborative effort where teams need to communicate to develop software products.
{{}}
Managers face the challenge of how to organise work to
facilitate necessary communication between teams and individuals.
{{}}
This includes a range
of decisions from distributing work over teams located in multiple buildings and sites,
through work processes and tools for coordinating work, to softer issues including ensuring well-functioning teams.
{{}}
In this case study, we focus on inter-team communication by
considering geographical, cognitive and psychological distances between teams, and factors and strategies that can affect this communication.
{{}}
Data was collected for ten test teams
within a large development organisation, in two main phases:
{{}}
(1) measuring cognitive and
psychological distance between teams using interactive posters, and (2) five focus group
sessions where the obtained distance measurements were discussed.
{{}}
We present ten factors
and five strategies, and how these relate to inter-team communication.
{{}}
We see three types
of arenas that facilitate inter-team communication, namely physical, virtual and organisational arenas.
{{}}
Our findings can support managers in assessing and improving communication within large development organisations.
{{}}
In addition, the findings can provide insights
into factors that may explain the challenges of scaling development organisations, in particular agile organisations that place a large emphasis on direct communication over written documentation.
