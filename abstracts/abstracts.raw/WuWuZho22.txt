Ethereum has been attracting lots of attacks, hence there is a pressing need to perform timely investigation
and detect more attack instances.
{{}}
However, existing systems suffer from the scalability issue due to the following reasons.
{{}}
First, the tight coupling between malicious contract detection and blockchain data importing
makes them infeasible to repeatedly detect different attacks.
{{}}
Second, the coarse-grained archive data makes
them inefficient to replay transactions.
{{}}
Third, the separation between malicious contract detection and runtime state recovery consumes lots of storage.
{{}}
In this article, we propose a scalable attack detection framework named EthScope, which overcomes the
scalability issue by neatly re-organizing the Ethereum state and efficiently locating suspicious transactions.
{{}}
It
leverages the fine-grained state to support the replay of arbitrary transactions and proposes a well-designed
schema to optimize the storage consumption.
{{}}
The performance evaluation shows that EthScope can solve the
scalability issue, i.e., efficiently performing a large-scale analysis on billions of transactions, and a speedup of
around 2,300Ã— when replaying transactions.
{{}}
It also has lower storage consumption compared with existing
systems.
{{}}
Further analysis shows that EthScope can help analysts understand attack behaviors and detect
more attack instances.
