A qualitative study of developers&apos; discussions of their problems and joys during the early COVID-19 months.

Many software developers started to work from home on a short notice during the early
periods of COVID-19.
{{}}
A number of previous papers have studied the wellbeing and productivity of software developers during COVID-19.
{{}}
The studies mainly use surveys based on
predefined questionnaires.
{{}}
In this paper, we investigate the problems and joys that software
developers experienced during the early months of COVID-19 by analyzing their discussions in online forum devRant, where discussions can be open and not bound by predefined
survey questionnaires.
{{}}
The devRant platform is designed for developers to share their joys
and frustrations of life.
{{}}
We manually analyze 825 devRant posts between January and April
12, 2020 that developers created to discuss their situation during COVID-19.
{{}}
WHO declared
COVID-19 as pandemic on March 11, 2020.
{{}}
As such, our data offers us insights in the
early months of COVID-19.
{{}}
We manually label each post along two dimensions:
{{}}
the topics of the discussion and the expressed sentiment polarity (positive, negative, neutral).
{{}}
We
observed 19 topics that we group into six categories:
{{}}
Workplace & Professional aspects,
Personal & Family well-being, Technical Aspects, Lockdown preparedness, Financial concerns, and Societal and Educational concerns.
{{}}
Around 49% of the discussions are negative
and 26% are positive.
{{}}
We find evidence of developersâ€™ struggles with lack of documentation
to work remotely and with their loneliness while working from home.
{{}}
We find stories of
their job loss with little or no savings to fallback to.
{{}}
The analysis of developer discussions
in the early months of a pandemic will help various stakeholders (e.g., software companies)
make important decision early to alleviate developer problems if such a pandemic or similar
emergency situation occurs in near future.
{{}}
Software engineering research can make further
efforts to develop automated tools for remote work (e.g., automated documentation).
