BugListener: Identifying and Synthesizing Bug Reports from Collaborative Live Chats.

In community-based software development, developers frequently
rely on live-chatting to discuss emergent bugs/errors they encounter
in daily development tasks.
{{}}
However, it remains a challenging task
to accurately record such knowledge due to the noisy nature of
interleaved dialogs in live chat data.
{{}}
In this paper, we first formulate
the task of identifying and synthesizing bug reports from commu-
nity live chats, and propose a novel approach, named BugListener,
to address the challenges.
{{}}
Specifically, BugListener automates three
sub-tasks:
{{}}
1) Disentangle the dialogs from massive chat logs by
using a Feed-Forward neural network; 2) Identify the bug-report
dialogs from separated dialogs by leveraging the Graph neural net-
work to learn the contextual information; 3) Synthesize the bug
reports by utilizing Transfer Learning techniques to classify the
sentences into:
{{}}
observed behaviors (OB), expected behaviors (EB),
and steps to reproduce the bug (SR).
{{}}
BugListener is evaluated on
six open source projects.
{{}}
The results show that:
{{}}
for bug report
identification, BugListener achieves the average F1 of 77.74%, im-
proving the best baseline by 12.96%; and for bug report synthesis
task, BugListener could classify the OB, EB, and SR sentences with
the F1 of 84.62%, 71.46%, and 73.13%, improving the best baselines by
9.32%, 12.21%, 10.91%, respectively.
{{}}
A human evaluation study also
confirms the effectiveness of BugListener in generating relevant and
accurate bug reports.
{{}}
These demonstrate the significant potential of
applying BugListener in community-based software development,
for promoting bug discovery and quality improvement.
