Automatic Test Case and Test Oracle Generation Based on Functional Scenarios in Formal Specifications for Conformance Testing.

Testing a program to confirm whether it consistently implements its requirements specification is a necessary but
time-consuming activity in software development.
{{}}
Automatic testing based on specifications can significantly alleviate the workload
and cost, but faces a challenge of how to ensure that both the user’s concerns in the specification and possible execution paths in the
program are all covered.
{{}}
In this paper, we describe a new method, called “Vibration-Method” or simply “V-Method” , for automatic
generation of test cases and test oracle from model-based formal specifications, aiming to address this challenge.
{{}}
The proposed
method is suitable for testing information systems in which rich data types are used.
{{}}
Supporting the principle of “divide and conquer” ,
the method provides a specific technique for generating test cases based on functional scenarios defined in the specification, test case
generation criteria, automatic test case generation algorithms, and a well-defined mechanism for deriving test oracle.
{{}}
We elaborate on
the method by discussing how initial test cases can be automatically generated, how additional necessary test cases are produced
using the “vibration” technique, and how a test oracle can be automatically derived for a group of test cases.
{{}}
We also describe a
controlled experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of the method and discuss the important issues in relation to the performance and
applicability of the method.
