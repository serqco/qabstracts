An empirical study of question discussions on Stack Overflow.

Stack Overflow provides a means for developers to exchange knowledge.
{{}}
While much previous research on Stack Overflow has focused on questions and answers (Q&A), recent work
has shown that discussions in comments also contain rich information.
{{}}
On Stack Overflow,
discussions through comments and chat rooms can be tied to questions or answers.
{{}}
In this
paper, we conduct an empirical study that focuses on the nature of question discussions.
{{}}
We
observe that:
{{}}
(1) Question discussions occur at all phases of the Q&A process, with most
beginning before the first answer is received.
{{}}
(2) Both askers and answerers actively participate in question discussions; the likelihood of their participation increases as the number
of comments increases.
{{}}
(3) There is a strong correlation between the number of question
comments and the question answering time (i.e., more discussed questions receive answers
more slowly).
{{}}
Our findings suggest that question discussions contain a rich trove of data
that is integral to the Q&A processes on Stack Overflow.
{{}}
We further suggest how future
research can leverage the information in question discussions, along with the commonly
studied Q&A information.
