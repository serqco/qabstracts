Refactoring embedded software: A study in healthcare domain.

Context:
{{}}
In embedded software industry, stakeholders usually promote run-time properties (e.g., performance,
energy efficiency, etc.) as quality drivers, which in many cases leads to a compromise at the levels of design-time
qualities (e.g., maintainability, reusability, etc.).
{{}}
Such a compromise does not come without a cost; since
embedded systems need heavy maintenance cycles.
{{}}
To assure effective bug-fixing, shorten the time required for
releasing updates, a refactoring of the software codebase needs to take place regularly.
{{}}
Objective:
{{}}
This study aims
to investigate how refactorings are applied in ES industry; and propose a systematic approach that can guide
refactoring through a 3-step process for refactoring:
{{}}
(a) planning; (b) design; and (c) evaluation.
{{}}
Method:
{{}}
The aforementioned goals were achieved by conducting a single case study in a company that develops
medical applications for bio-impedance devices; and follows a rather systematic refactoring process in periodic
timestamps.
{{}}
Three data collection approaches have been used:
{{}}
surveys, interviews (10 practitioners), and artifact
analysis (51 refactoring activities).
{{}}
Results:
{{}}
The results of the study suggest that:
{{}}
(a) maintainability and reusability are the design-time quality
attributes that motivate the refactoring of Embedded Software (ES), with 30% of the participants considering
them as of “Very High” importance; (b) the refactorings that are most frequently performed are “Extract
Method”, “Replace Magic Number with Constant” and “Remove Parameter”.
{{}}
We note that the “Extract Method”
refactoring has an applicability of more than over 80%; and (c) to evaluate the refactoring process engineers use
tools producing structural metrics, internal standards, and reviews.
{{}}
Conclusions:
{{}}
The outcomes of this study can be useful to both researchers and practitioners, in the sense that the
former can focus their efforts on aspects that are meaningful to industry, whereas the latter are provided with a
systematic refactoring process.
