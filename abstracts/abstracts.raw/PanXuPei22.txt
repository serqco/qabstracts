GUI-Guided Test Script Repair for Mobile Apps.

Graphical User Interface (GUI) testing is widely used to test mobile apps.
{{}}
As mobile apps are frequently updated and need
repeated testing, to reduce the test cost, their test cases are often coded as scripts to enable automated execution using test harnesses/
tools.
{{}}
When those mobile apps evolve, many of the test scripts, however, may become broken due to changes made to the app GUIs.
{{}}
While it is desirable that the broken scripts get repaired, doing it manually can be preventively expensive if the number of tests need
repairing is large.
{{}}
We propose in this paper a novel approach named METER to repairing broken GUI test scripts automatically when mobile
apps evolve.
{{}}
METER leverages computer vision techniques to infer GUI changes between two versions of a mobile app and uses the
inferred changes to guide the repair of GUI test scripts.
{{}}
Since METER only relies on screenshots to repair GUI tests, it is applicable to apps
targeting open or closed source mobile platforms.
{{}}
In experiments conducted on 22 Android apps and 6 iOS apps, repairs produced by
METER helped preserve 63.7 and 38.8 percent of all the test actions broken by the GUI changes, respectively.
