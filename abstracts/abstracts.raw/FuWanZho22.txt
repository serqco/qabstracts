How resource utilization influences UI responsiveness of Android software.

Context:
{{}}
The rapid responsiveness of smartphones is critical to user experience.
{{}}
Excessive resource utilization
is typically considered as one of the major factors leading to laggy-UI.
{{}}
Much work focuses on modifying
the design of Android systems and software to reduce their resource utilization.
{{}}
However, laggy-UI is still
quite common on Android devices, especially the low-end ones.
{{}}
One reason is that developers still lack a
clear understanding about how the utilization of various resources (e.g., CPU and memory) affects Android
responsiveness, which leads to the inadequacy of existing performance optimization measures.
{{}}
Objective:
{{}}
The objective of this paper is to obtain a systematical understanding of how the utilization of
various resources (e.g., CPU and memory) affects Android responsiveness.
{{}}
Then accordingly, we aim to figure
out the root cause(s) of laggy-UI.
{{}}
Methods:
{{}}
First, we conduct a set of controlled experiments on two Android devices with a stress test tool.
{{}}
Second, we further test 36 real-life Android software to study whether the competition of resource(s), the root
factor(s) causing laggy-UI, is severe in real-life scenarios.
{{}}
Results:
{{}}
The experimental results show that CPU competition is the root cause and other resources have no
observable impact on Android responsiveness, except in extreme cases, e.g., utilization reaches almost 100%.
{{}}
We also find out CPU competition is quite common for existing Android software when it is running in the
background.
{{}}
Conclusion:
{{}}
Through stress testing and real-life Android software testing, this work unveils that CPU competition should be the main problem to be solved.
{{}}
Our experimental results deepen and update previous perceptions
of resourcesâ€™ impact on Android responsiveness.
{{}}
Based on these findings, we provide a set of suggestions for
designing high-performance Android systems and software, and effective performance optimization tools.
