MVD: Memory-Related Vulnerability Detection Based on Flow-Sensitive Graph Neural Networks.

Memory-related vulnerabilities constitute severe threats to the secu-
rity of modern software.
{{}}
Despite the success of deep learning-based
approaches to generic vulnerability detection, they are still limited
by the underutilization of flow information when applied for detect-
ing memory-related vulnerabilities, leading to high false positives.
{{}}
In this paper, we propose MVD, a statement-level Memory-related
Vulnerability Detection approach based on flow-sensitive graph
neural networks (FS-GNN).
{{}}
FS-GNN is employed to jointly em-
bed both unstructured information (i.e., source code) and struc-
tured information (i.e., control- and data-flow) to capture implicit
memory-related vulnerability patterns.
{{}}
We evaluate MVD on the
dataset which contains 4,353 real-world memory-related vulnera-
bilities, and compare our approach with three state-of-the-art deep
learning-based approaches as well as five popular static analysis-
based memory detectors.
{{}}
The experiment results show that MVD
achieves better detection accuracy, outperforming both state-of-the-
art DL-based and static analysis-based approaches.
{{}}
Furthermore,
MVD makes a great trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.
