ReMoS: Reducing Defect Inheritance in Transfer Learning via Relevant Model Slicing.

Transfer learning is a popular software reuse technique in the deep
learning community that enables developers to build custom mod-
els (students) based on sophisticated pretrained models (teachers).
{{}}
However, like vulnerability inheritance in traditional software reuse,
some defects in the teacher model may also be inherited by students,
such as well-known adversarial vulnerabilities and backdoors.
{{}}
Re-
ducing such defects is challenging since the student is unaware of
how the teacher is trained and/or attacked.
{{}}
In this paper, we propose
ReMoS, a relevant model slicing technique to reduce defect inheri-
tance during transfer learning while retaining useful knowledge from
the teacher model.
{{}}
Speciﬁcally, ReMoS computes a model slice (a
subset of model weights) that is relevant to the student task based on
the neuron coverage information obtained by proﬁling the teacher
