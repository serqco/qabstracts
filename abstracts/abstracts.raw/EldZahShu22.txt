Do I really need all this work to find vulnerabilities?

Context:
{{}}
Applying vulnerability detection techniques is one of many tasks using the limited
resources of a software project.
{{}}
Objective:
{{}}
The goal of this research is to assist managers and other decision-makers in making informed choices about the use of software vulnerability detection techniques through
an empirical study of the efficiency and effectiveness of four techniques on a Java-based
web application.
{{}}
Method:
{{}}
We apply four different categories of vulnerability detection techniques – systematic manual penetration testing (SMPT), exploratory manual penetration testing (EMPT),
dynamic application security testing (DAST), and static application security testing (SAST)
– to an open-source medical records system.
{{}}
Results:
{{}}
We found the most vulnerabilities using SAST.
{{}}
However, EMPT found more
severe vulnerabilities.
{{}}
With each technique, we found unique vulnerabilities not found using
the other techniques.
{{}}
The efficiency of manual techniques (EMPT, SMPT) was comparable to or better than the efficiency of automated techniques (DAST, SAST) in terms of
Vulnerabilities per Hour (VpH).
{{}}
Conclusions:
{{}}
The vulnerability detection technique practitioners should select may vary
based on the goals and available resources of the project.
{{}}
If the goal of an organization
is to find “all” vulnerabilities in a project, they need to use as many techniques as their
resources allow.
