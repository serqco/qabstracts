An Empirical Study of C++ Vulnerabilities in Crowd-Sourced Code Examples.

Software developers share programming solutions in Q&A sites like Stack Overflow, Stack Exchange, Android forum, and
so on.
{{}}
The reuse of crowd-sourced code snippets can facilitate rapid prototyping.
{{}}
However, recent research shows that the shared code
snippets may be of low quality and can even contain vulnerabilities.
{{}}
This paper aims to understand the nature and the prevalence of
security vulnerabilities in crowd-sourced code examples.
{{}}
To achieve this goal, we investigate security vulnerabilities in the C++ code
snippets shared on Stack Overflow over a period of 10 years.
{{}}
In collaborative sessions involving multiple human coders, we manually
assessed each code snippet for security vulnerabilities following CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) guidelines.
{{}}
From the 72,483
reviewed code snippets used in at least one project hosted on GitHub, we found a total of 99 vulnerable code snippets categorized into
31 types.
{{}}
Many of the investigated code snippets are still not corrected on Stack Overflow.
{{}}
The 99 vulnerable code snippets found in
Stack Overflow were reused in a total of 2859 GitHub projects.
{{}}
To help improve the quality of code snippets shared on Stack Overflow,
we developed a browser extension that allows Stack Overflow users to be notified for vulnerabilities in code snippets when they see
them on the platform.
