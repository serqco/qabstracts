Increasing the impact of software engineering research in the software industry and the society at large has
long been a concern of high priority for the software engineering community.
{{}}
The problem of two cultures,
research conducted in a vacuum (disconnected from the real world), or misaligned time horizons are just
some of the many complex challenges standing in the way of successful industry–academia collaborations.
{{}}
This article reports on the experience of research collaboration and knowledge co-creation between industry
and academia in software engineering as a way to bridge the research–practice collaboration gap.
{{}}
Our experience spans 14 years of collaboration between researchers in software engineering and the European and
Norwegian software and IT industry.
{{}}
Using the participant observation and interview methods, we have collected and afterwards analyzed an extensive record of qualitative data.
{{}}
Drawing upon the findings made and
the experience gained, we provide a set of 14 patterns and 14 anti-patterns for industry–academia collaborations, aimed to support other researchers and practitioners in establishing and running research collaboration
projects in software engineering.
