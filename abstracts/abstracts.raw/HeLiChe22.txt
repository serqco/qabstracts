Diversified Third-Party Library Prediction for Mobile App Development.

The rapid growth of mobile apps has significantly promoted the use of third-party libraries in mobile app development.
{{}}
However,
mobile app developers are now facing the challenge of finding useful third-party libraries for improving their apps, e.g., to enhance user
interfaces, to add social features, etc.
{{}}
An effective approach is to leverage collaborative filtering (CF) to predict useful third-party libraries for
developers.
{{}}
We employed Matrix Factorization (MF) approaches - the classic CF-based prediction approaches - to make the predictions
based on a total of 31,432 Android apps from Google Play.
{{}}
However, our investigation shows that there is a significant lack of diversity in
the prediction results - a small fraction of popular third-party libraries dominate the prediction results while most other libraries are ill-served.
{{}}
The low diversity in the prediction results limits the usefulness of the prediction because it lacks novelty and serendipity which are much
appreciated by mobile app developers.
{{}}
In order to increase the diversity in the prediction results, we designed an innovative MF-based
approach, namely LibSeek, specifically for predicting useful third-party libraries for mobile apps.
{{}}
It employs an adaptive weighting
mechanism to neutralize the bias caused by the popularity of third-party libraries.
{{}}
In addition, it introduces neighborhood information, i.e.,
information about similar apps and similar third-party libraries, to personalize the predictions for individual apps.
{{}}
The experimental results
show that LibSeek can significantly diversify the prediction results, and in the meantime, increase the prediction accuracy.
