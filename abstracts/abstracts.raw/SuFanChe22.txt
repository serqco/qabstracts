Why My App Crashes? Understanding and Benchmarking Framework-Specific Exceptions of Android Apps.

Mobile apps have become ubiquitous.
{{}}
Ensuring their correctness and reliability is important.
{{}}
However, many apps still
suffer from occasional to frequent crashes, weakening their competitive edge.
{{}}
Large-scale, deep analyses of the characteristics of realworld app crashes can provide useful insights to both developers and researchers.
{{}}
However, such studies are difficult and yet to be
carried out — this work fills this gap.
{{}}
We collected 16,245 and 8,760 unique exceptions from 2,486 open-source and 3,230 commercial
Android apps, respectively, and observed that the exceptions thrown from Android framework (termed “ framework-specific
exceptions” ) account for the majority.
{{}}
With one-year effort, we (1) extensively investigated these framework-specific exceptions, and
(2) further conducted an online survey of 135 professional app developers about how they analyze, test, reproduce and fix these
exceptions.
{{}}
Specifically, we aim to understand the framework-specific exceptions from several perspectives:
{{}}
(i) their characteristics
(e.g., manifestation locations, fault taxonomy), (ii) the developers’ testing practices, (iii) existing bug detection techniques’
effectiveness, (iv) their reproducibility and (v) bug fixes.
{{}}
To enable follow-up research (e.g., bug understanding, detection, localization
and repairing), we further systematically constructed, DroidDefects, the first comprehensive and largest benchmark of Android app
exception bugs.
{{}}
This benchmark contains 33 reproducible exceptions (with test cases, stack traces, faulty and fixed app versions, bug
types, etc.), and 3,696 ground-truth exceptions (real faults manifested by automated testing tools), which cover the apps with different
complexities and diverse exception types.
{{}}
Based on our findings, we also built two prototype tools:
{{}}
Stoat+, an optimized dynamic
testing tool, which quickly uncovered three previously-unknown, fixed crashes in Gmail and Google+; ExLocator, an exception
localization tool, which can locate the root causes of specific exception types.

Our dataset, benchmark and tools are publicly available
on https://github.com/tingsu/droiddefects.
