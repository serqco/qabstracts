What happens in my code reviews? An investigation on automatically classifying review changes.

Code reviewing is a widespread practice used by software engineers to maintain high code
quality.
{{}}
To date, the knowledge on the effect of code review on source code is still limited.
{{}}
Some studies have addressed this problem by classifying the types of changes that take
place during the review process (a.k.a.
{{}}
review changes), as this strategy can, for example,
pinpoint the immediate effect of reviews on code.
{{}}
Nevertheless, this classification (1) is not
scalable, as it was conducted manually, and (2) was not assessed in terms of how meaningful the provided information is for practitioners.
{{}}
This paper aims at addressing these
limitations:
{{}}
First, we investigate to what extent a machine learning-based technique can
automatically classify review changes.
{{}}
Then, we evaluate the relevance of information on
review change types and its potential usefulness, by conducting (1) semi-structured interviews with 12 developers and (2) a qualitative study with 17 developers, who are asked to
assess reports on the review changes of their project.
{{}}
Key results of the study show that
not only it is possible to automatically classify code review changes, but this information
is also perceived by practitioners as valuable to improve the code review process.
