A Compositional Approach for Complex Event Pattern Modeling and Transformation to Colored Petri Nets with Black Sequencing Transitions.

Prioritized Colored Petri Nets (PCPNs) are a well-known extension of plain Petri nets in which transitions can have priorities
and the tokens on the places carry data information.
{{}}
In this paper, we propose an extension of the PCPN model with black sequencing
transitions (BPCPN).
{{}}
This extension allows us to easily model the ordered firing of the same transition using an ordered set of tokens on
one of its precondition places.
{{}}
Black sequencing transitions are then presented as a shorthand notation in order to model the
processing of a flow of events, represented by one of their precondition places.
{{}}
We then show how black sequencing transitions can be
encoded into PCPNs, and their application to model Complex Event Processing (CEP), defining a compositional approach to translate
some of the most relevant event pattern operators.
{{}}
We have developed MEdit4CEP-BPCPN, an extension of the MEdit4CEP tool, to
provide tool support for this novel technique, thus allowing end users to easily define event patterns and obtain an automatic translation
into BPCPNs.
{{}}
This can, in turn, be transformed into a corresponding PCPN, and then be immediately used in CPN Tools.
{{}}
Finally, a
health case study concerning the monitoring of pregnant women is considered to illustrate how the event patterns are created and how
the BPCPN and PCPN models are obtained by using the MEdit4CEP-BPCPN tool.
