A Survey of Performance Optimization for Mobile Applications.

To ensure user satisfaction and success of mobile applications, it is important to provide highly performant applications.
{{}}
This is particularly important for resource-constrained systems such as mobile devices.
{{}}
Thereby, non-functional performance
characteristics, such as energy and memory consumption, play an important role for user satisfaction.
{{}}
This paper provides a
comprehensive survey of non-functional performance optimization for Android applications.
{{}}
We collected 156 unique publications,
published between 2008 and 2020, that focus on the optimization of performance of mobile applications.
{{}}
We target our search at four
performance characteristics:
{{}}
responsiveness, launch time, memory and energy consumption.
{{}}
For each performance characteristic, we
categorize optimization approaches based on the method used in the corresponding publications.
{{}}
Furthermore, we identify research
gaps in the literature for future work.
