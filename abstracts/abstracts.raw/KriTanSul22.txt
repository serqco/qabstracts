ConEx: Efficient Exploration of Big-Data System Configurations for Better Performance.

Configuration space complexity makes the big-data software systems hard to configure well.
{{}}
Consider Hadoop, with over
nine hundred parameters, developers often just use the default configurations provided with Hadoop distributions.
{{}}
The opportunity costs
in lost performance are significant.
{{}}
Popular learning-based approaches to auto-tune software does not scale well for big-data systems
because of the high cost of collecting training data.
{{}}
We present a new method based on a combination of Evolutionary Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (EMCMC) sampling and cost reduction techniques to find better-performing configurations for big data systems.
{{}}
For cost
reduction, we developed and experimentally tested and validated two approaches:
{{}}
using scaled-up big data jobs as proxies for the
objective function for larger jobs and using a dynamic job similarity measure to infer that results obtained for one kind of big data problem
will work well for similar problems.
{{}}
Our experimental results suggest that our approach promises to improve the performance of big data
systems significantly and that it outperforms competing approaches based on random sampling, basic genetic algorithms (GA), and
predictive model learning.
{{}}
Our experimental results support the conclusion that our approach strongly demonstrates the potential to
improve the performance of big data systems significantly and frugally.
