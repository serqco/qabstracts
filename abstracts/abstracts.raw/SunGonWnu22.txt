Towards an Anatomy of Software Craftsmanship.


Context:
{{}}
The concept of software craftsmanship has early roots in computing, and in 2009, the Manifesto for
Software Craftsmanship was formulated as a reaction to how the Agile methods were practiced and taught.
{{}}
But software craftsmanship has seldom been studied from a software engineering perspective.
{{}}
Objective:
{{}}
The objective of this article is to systematize an anatomy of software craftsmanship through
literature studies and a longitudinal case study.
{{}}
Method:
{{}}
We performed a snowballing literature review based on an initial set of nine papers, resulting
in 18 papers and 11 books.
{{}}
We also performed a case study following seven years of software development
of a product for the financial market, eliciting qualitative, and quantitative results.
{{}}
We used thematic coding
to synthesize the results into categories.
{{}}
Results:
{{}}
The resulting anatomy is centered around four themes, containing 17 principles and 47 hierarchical practices connected to the principles.
{{}}
We present the identified practices based on the experiences
gathered from the case study, triangulating with the literature results.
{{}}
Conclusion:
{{}}
We provide our systematically derived anatomy of software craftsmanship with the goal of
inspiring more research into the principles and practices of software craftsmanship and how these relate to
other principles within software engineering in general.
