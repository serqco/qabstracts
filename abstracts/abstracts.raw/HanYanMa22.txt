Control Parameters Considered Harmful: Detecting Range Specification Bugs in Drone Configuration Modules via Learning-Guided Search.

In order to support a variety of missions and deal with different
flight environments, drone control programs typically provide con-
figurable control parameters.
{{}}
However, such a flexibility introduces
vulnerabilities.
{{}}
One such vulnerability, referred to as range specifica-
tion bugs, has been recently identified.
{{}}
The vulnerability originates
from the fact that even though each individual parameter receives
a value in the recommended value range, certain combinations of
parameter values may affect the drone physical stability.
{{}}
In this
paper, we develop a novel learning-guided search system to find
such combinations, that we refer to as incorrect configurations.
{{}}
Our
system applies metaheuristic search algorithms mutating config-
urations to detect the configuration parameters that have values
driving the drone to unstable physical states.
{{}}
To guide the muta-
tions, our system leverages a machine learning based predictor as
the fitness evaluator.
{{}}
Finally, by utilizing multi-objective optimiza-
tion, our system returns the feasible ranges based on the mutation
search results.
{{}}
Because in our system the mutations are guided by a
predictor, evaluating the parameter configurations does not require
realistic/simulation executions.
{{}}
Therefore, our system supports a
