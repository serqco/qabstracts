Styler: learning formatting conventions to repair Checkstyle violations.

Ensuring the consistent usage of formatting conventions is an important aspect of modern
software quality assurance.
{{}}
To do so, the source code of a project should be checked against
the formatting conventions (or rules) adopted by its development team, and then the detected
violations should be repaired if any.
{{}}
While the former task can be automatically done by format checkers implemented in linters, there is no satisfactory solution for the latter.
{{}}
Manually
fixing formatting convention violations is a waste of developer time and code formatters do
not take into account the conventions adopted and configured by developers for the used
linter.
{{}}
In this paper, we present STYLER, a tool dedicated to fixing formatting rule violations raised by format checkers using a machine learning approach.
{{}}
For a given project,
STYLER first generates training data by injecting violations of the project-specific rules in
violation-free source code files.
{{}}
Then, it learns fixes by feeding long short-term memory
neural networks with the training data encoded into token sequences.
{{}}
Finally, it predicts
fixes for real formatting violations with the trained models.
{{}}
Currently, STYLER supports
a single checker, Checkstyle, which is a highly configurable and popular format checker
for Java.
{{}}
In an empirical evaluation, STYLER repaired 41% of 26,791 Checkstyle violations mined from 104 GitHub projects.
{{}}
Moreover, we compared STYLER with the IntelliJ
plugin CHECKSTYLE-IDEA and the machine-learning-based code formatters NATURALIZE
and CODEBUFF.
{{}}
We found out that STYLER fixes violations of a diverse set of Checkstyle
rules (24/25 rules), generates smaller repairs in comparison to the other systems, and predicts repairs in seconds once trained on a project.
{{}}
Through a manual analysis, we identified
cases in which STYLER does not succeed to generate correct repairs, which can guide further improvements in STYLER.
{{}}
Finally, the results suggest that STYLER can be useful to
help developers repair Checkstyle formatting violations.
