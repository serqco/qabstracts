Automated Expansion of Abbreviations Based on Semantic Relation and Transfer Expansion.

Although the negative impact of abbreviations in source code is well-recognized, abbreviations are common for various
reasons.
{{}}
To this end, a number of approaches have been proposed to expand abbreviations in identifiers.
{{}}
However, such approaches
are either inaccurate or confined to specific identifiers.
{{}}
To this end, in this paper, we propose a generic and accurate approach to
expand identifier abbreviations by leveraging both semantic relation and transfer expansion.
{{}}
One of the key insights of the approach is
that abbreviations in the name of software entity e have a great chance to find their full terms in names of software entities that are
semantically related to e.
{{}}
Consequently, the proposed approach builds a knowledge graph to represent such entities and their
relationships with e and searches the graph for full terms.
{{}}
Another key insight is that literally identical abbreviations within the same
application are likely (but not necessary) to have identical expansions, and thus the semantics-based expansion in one place may be
transferred to other places.
{{}}
To investigate when abbreviation expansion could be transferred safely, we conduct a case study on three
open-source applications.
{{}}
The results suggest that a significant part (75 percent) of expansions could be transferred among lexically
identical abbreviations within the same application.
{{}}
However, the risk of transfer varies according to various factors, e.g., length of
abbreviations, the physical distance between abbreviations, and semantic relations between abbreviations.
{{}}
Based on these findings,
we design nine heuristics for transfer expansion and propose a learning-based approach to prioritize both transfer heuristics and
semantic-based expansion heuristics.
{{}}
Evaluation results on nine open-source applications suggest that the proposed approach
significantly improves the state of the art, improving recall from 29 to 89 percent and precision from 39 to 92 percent.
