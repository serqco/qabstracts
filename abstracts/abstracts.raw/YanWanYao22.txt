DescribeCtx: Context-Aware Description Synthesis for Sensitive Behaviors in Mobile Apps.

While mobile applications (i.e., apps) are becoming capable of han-
dling various needs from users, their increasing access to sensitive
data raises privacy concerns.
{{}}
To inform such sensitive behaviors
to users, existing techniques propose to automatically identify ex-
planatory sentences from app descriptions; however, many sensitive
behaviors are not explained in the corresponding app descriptions.
{{}}
There also exist general techniques that translate code to sentences.
{{}}
However, these techniques lack the vocabulary to explain the uses
of sensitive data and fail to consider the context (i.e., the app func-
tionalities) of the sensitive behaviors.
{{}}
To address these limitations,
we propose DescribeCtx, a context-aware description synthesis
approach that trains a neural machine translation model using a
large set of popular apps, and generates app-specific descriptions
for sensitive behaviors.
{{}}
Specifically, DescribeCtx encodes three
heterogeneous sources as input, i.e., vocabularies provided by pri-
vacy policies, behavior summary provided by the call graphs in code,
and contextual information provided by GUI texts.
{{}}
Our evaluations
on 1,262 Android apps show that, compared with existing baselines,
DescribeCtx produces more accurate descriptions (24.96 in 𝐵𝐿𝐸𝑈 )
and achieves higher user ratings with respect to the reference sen-
tences manually identified in the app descriptions.
