Will you come back to contribute? Investigating the inactivity of OSS core developers in GitHub.

Several Open-Source Software (OSS) projects depend on the continuity of their development
communities to remain sustainable.
{{}}
Understanding how developers become inactive or why
they take breaks can help communities prevent abandonment and incentivize developers to
come back.
{{}}
In this paper, we propose a novel method to identify developers’ inactive periods
by analyzing the individual rhythm of contributions to the projects.
{{}}
Using this method, we
quantitatively analyze the inactivity of core developers in 18 OSS organizations hosted on
GitHub.
{{}}
We also survey core developers to receive their feedback about the identified breaks
and transitions.
{{}}
Our results show that our method was effective for identifying developers’
breaks.
{{}}
About 94% of the surveyed core developers agreed with our state model of inactivity;
71% and 79% of them acknowledged their breaks and state transition, respectively.
{{}}
We also
show that all core developers take breaks (at least once) and about a half of them (~45%) have
completely disengaged from a project for at least one year.
{{}}
We also analyzed the probability of
transitions to/from inactivity and found that developers who pause their activity have a ~35 to
~55% chance to return to an active state; yet, if the break lasts for a year or longer, then the
probability of resuming activities drops to ~21–26%, with a ~54% chance of complete
disengagement.
{{}}
These results may support the creation of policies and mechanisms to make
OSS community managers aware of breaks and potential project abandonment.
