Combining multiple granularity variability in a software product line approach for web engineering.

Context:
{{}}
Web engineering involves managing a high diversity of artifacts implemented in different languages
and with different levels of granularity.
{{}}
Technological companies usually implement variable artifacts of
Software Product Lines (SPLs) using annotations, being reluctant to adopt hybrid, often complex, approaches
combining composition and annotations despite their benefits.
{{}}
Objective:
{{}}
This paper proposes a combined approach to support fine and coarse-grained variability for web
artifacts.
{{}}
The proposal allows web developers to continue using annotations to handle fine-grained variability
for those artifacts whose variability is very difficult to implement with a composition-based approach, but
obtaining the advantages of the composition-based approach for the coarse-grained variable artifacts.
{{}}
Methods:
{{}}
A combined approach based on feature modeling that integrates annotations into a generic
composition-based approach.
{{}}
We propose the definition of compositional and annotative variation points
with custom-defined semantics, which is resolved by a scaffolding-based derivation engine.
{{}}
The approach is
evaluated on a real-world web-based SPL by applying a set of variability metrics, as well as discussing its
quality criteria in comparison with annotations, compositional, and combined existing approaches.
{{}}
Results:
{{}}
Our approach effectively handles both fine and coarse-grained variability.
{{}}
The mapping between the
feature model and the web artifacts promotes the traceability of the features and the uniformity of the variation
points regardless of the granularity of the web artifacts.
{{}}
Conclusions:
{{}}
Using well-known techniques of SPLs from an architectural point of view, such as feature
modeling, can improve the design and maintenance of variable web artifacts without the need of introducing
complex approaches for implementing the underlying variability.
