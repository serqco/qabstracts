Leveraging execution traces to enhance traceability links recovery in BPMN models.

Context:
{{}}
Traceability Links Recovery has been a topic of interest for many years, resulting in techniques that
perform traceability based on the linguistic clues of the software artifacts under study.
{{}}
However, BPMN models
tend to present an overall lack of linguistic clues when compared to code-based artifacts or code generation
models.
{{}}
Hence, TLR becomes a harder task when performed among requirements and BPMN models.
{{}}
Objective:
{{}}
This paper proposes a novel approach, called METRA, that leverages the execution traces of BPMN
to expand the BPMN models.
{{}}
The expansion of the BPMN models enhances their linguistic clues, bridging
the language between BPMN models and other software artifacts, and improving the TLR process between
requirements and BPMN models.
{{}}
Methods:
{{}}
The proposed approach is evaluated through a real-world industrial case study, comparing its
outcomes against two state-of-the-art baselines, TLR and LORE.
{{}}
The paper also evaluates the combination
of METRA with LORE against the rest of the approaches, including standalone METRA.
{{}}
The evaluation process
generates a report of measurements (precision, recall, f-measure, and MCC), over which a statistical analysis
is conducted.
{{}}
Results:
{{}}
Results show that approaches based on METRA maintain the excellent precision results obtained
by baseline approaches (74.2% for METRA, 78.8% for METRA+LORE), whilst also improving the recall
results from the unacceptable values obtained by the baselines to good values (72.4% for METRA, 73.9%
for METRA+LORE).
{{}}
Moreover, according to the statistical analysis, the differences in the results obtained by
the evaluated approaches are statistically significant.
{{}}
Conclusions:
{{}}
This paper opens a novel field of work in TLR by analyzing the improvement of the TLR process
through the inclusion of linguistic clues present in execution traces, and discusses ideas for further research
that can delve into this promising direction explored by our work.
