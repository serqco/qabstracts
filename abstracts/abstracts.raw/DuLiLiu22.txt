Windranger: A Directed Greybox Fuzzer driven by Deviation Basic Blocks.

Directed grey-box fuzzing (DGF) is a security testing technique
that aims to steer the fuzzer towards predefined target sites in the
program.
{{}}
To gain directedness, DGF prioritizes the seeds whose
execution traces are closer to the target sites.
{{}}
Therefore, evaluating
the distance between the execution trace of a seed and the target
sites (aka, the seed distance) is important for DGF.
{{}}
The first directed
grey-box fuzzer, AFLGo, uses an approach of calculating the basic
block level distances during static analysis and accumulating the
distances of the executed basic blocks to compute the seed distance.
{{}}
Following AFLGo, most of the existing state-of-the-art DGF tech-
niques use all the basic blocks on the execution trace and only the
control flow information for seed distance calculation.
{{}}
However,
not every basic block is equally important and there are certain
basic blocks where the execution trace starts to deviate from the
target sites (aka, deviation basic blocks).
{{}}
In this paper, we propose a technique called WindRanger which
leverages deviation basic blocks to facilitate DGF.
{{}}
To identify the
deviation basic blocks, WindRanger applies both static reacha-
bility analysis and dynamic filtering.
{{}}
To conduct directed fuzzing,
WindRanger uses the deviation basic blocks and their related
data flow information for seed distance calculation, mutation, seed
prioritization as well as explore-exploit scheduling.
{{}}
We evaluated
WindRanger on 3 datasets consisting of 29 programs.
{{}}
The exper-
iment results show that WindRanger outperforms AFLGo, AFL,
and FairFuzz by reaching the target sites 21%, 34%, and 37% faster
and detecting the target crashes 44%, 66%, and 77% faster respec-
tively.
{{}}
Moreover, we found a 0-day vulnerability with a CVE ID
assigned in ffmpeg (a popular multimedia library extensively fuzzed
by OSS-fuzz) with WindRanger by supplying manually identified
suspect locations as the target sites.
