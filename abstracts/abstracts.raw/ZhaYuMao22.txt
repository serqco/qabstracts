FENSE: A feature-based ensemble modeling approach to cross-project just-in-time defect prediction.

Context:
{{}}
Just-in-time defect prediction (JITDP) leverages modern machine learning models to predict the defect-proneness of commits.
{{}}
Such models require adequate training
data, which is unavailable in projects with short histories.
{{}}
To address this problem, crossproject methods reuse the data or models in other projects to make predictions, grounded on
the assumption that they share similar defect-related features.
{{}}
However, these features are
overlooked, which leads to unsatisfying model performance.
{{}}
Objective:
{{}}
This study aims to investigate the relationship between cross-project JITDP performances and project features, thereby improving the performance of cross-project models.
{{}}
Method:
{{}}
We propose a Feature-based ENSEmble modeling approach (FENSE) to crossproject JITDP.
{{}}
For a target project, FENSE pairs it to each source project and obtains 20
features.
{{}}
Leveraging them, it can predict the transferability of each off-the-shelf JITDP
model.
{{}}
Then FENSE identifies the most transferable ones and combines them to make crossproject predictions.
{{}}
To achieve this, we conduct a large-scale empirical study of 113,906
project pairs in GitHub and investigate the impact of project features.
{{}}
Results:
{{}}
The results show that:
{{}}
(1) cross-project transferability is highly related to features
including programming language and the defect ratio of the source project; (2) our featurebased model selection scheme can improve the cross-project JITDP performance by 10%;
(3) FENSE outperforms other models on five evaluation measures without extra time and
space costs.
{{}}
Conclusions:
{{}}
Our study suggests that project features can help identify powerful crossproject JITDP models and improve the performance of ensemble approaches.
