Preventing technical debt with the TAP framework for Technical Debt Aware Management.

Context:
{{}}
Technical Debt (TD) is a metaphor for technical problems that are not visible to users and customers
but hinder developers in their work, making future changes more difficult.
{{}}
TD is often incurred due to tight
project deadlines and can make future changes more costly or impossible.
{{}}
Project Management usually focuses
on customer benefits and pays less attention to their IT systems’ internal quality.
{{}}
TD prevention should be
preferred over TD repayment because subsequent refactoring and re-engineering are expensive.
{{}}
Objective:
{{}}
This paper evaluates a framework focusing on both TD prevention and TD repayment in the context
of agile-managed projects.
{{}}
The framework was developed and applied in an IT unit of a publishing house.
{{}}
The
unique contribution of this framework is the integration of TD management into project management.
{{}}
Method:
{{}}
The evaluation was performed as a comparative case study based on ticket statistics and two
structured surveys.
{{}}
The surveys were conducted in the observed IT unit using the framework and a comparison
unit not using the framework.
{{}}
The first survey targeted team members, the second one IT managers.
{{}}
Results:
{{}}
The evaluation shows that in this IT unit the TAP framework led to a raised awareness for the
incurrence of TD.
{{}}
Decisions to incur TD are intentional, and TD is repaid timelier.
{{}}
Unintentional TD incurred
by unconscious decisions is prevented.
{{}}
Furthermore, better communication and better planning of the project
pipeline can be observed.
{{}}
Conclusion:
{{}}
We provide an insight into practitioners’ ways to identify, monitor, prevent and repay TD.
{{}}
The
presented framework includes a feasible method for TD prevention despite tight timelines by making TD
repayment part of project management.
