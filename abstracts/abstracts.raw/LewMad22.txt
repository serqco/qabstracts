How far are we from reproducible research on code smell detection? A systematic literature review.

Context:
{{}}
Code smells are symptoms of wrong design decisions or coding shortcuts that may increase defect
rate and decrease maintainability.
{{}}
Research on code smells is accelerating, focusing on code smell detection
and using code smells as defect predictors.
{{}}
Recent research shows that even between software developers,
agreement on what constitutes a code smell is low, but several publications claim the high performance of
detection algorithms—which seems counterintuitive, considering that algorithms should be taught on data
labeled by developers.
{{}}
Objective:
{{}}
This paper aims to investigate the possible reasons for the inconsistencies between studies in the
performance of applied machine learning algorithms compared to developers.
{{}}
It focuses on the reproducibility
of existing studies.
{{}}
Methods:
{{}}
A systematic literature review was performed among conference and journal articles published
between 1999 and 2020 to assess the state of reproducibility of the research performed in those papers.
{{}}
A
quasi-gold standard procedure was used to validate the search.
{{}}
Modeling process descriptions, reproduction
scripts, data sets, and techniques used for their creation were analyzed.
{{}}
Results:
{{}}
We obtained data from 46 publications.
{{}}
22 of them contained a detailed description of the modeling
process, 17 included any reproduction data (data set, results, or scripts) and 15 used existing data sets.
{{}}
In
most of the publications, analyzed projects were hand-picked by the researchers.
{{}}
Conclusion:
{{}}
Most studies do not include any form of an online reproduction package, although this has started
to change recently—8% of analyzed studies published before 2018 included a full reproduction package,
compared to 22% in years 2018-2019.
{{}}
Ones that do include a package usually use a research group website
or even a personal one.
{{}}
Dedicated archives are still rarely used for data packages.
{{}}
We recommend that
researchers include complete reproduction packages for their studies and use well-established research data
archives instead of their own websites.
