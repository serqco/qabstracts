From anecdote to evidence: the relationship between personality and need for cognition of developers.

There is considerable anecdotal evidence suggesting that software engineers enjoy engaging
in solving puzzles and other cognitive efforts.
{{}}
A tendency to engage in and enjoy effortful
thinking is referred to as a person’s ‘need for cognition.’ In this article we study the relationship between software engineers’ personality traits and their need for cognition.
{{}}
Through
a large-scale sample study of 483 respondents we collected data to capture the six ‘bright’
personality traits of the HEXACO model of personality, and three ‘dark’ personality traits.
{{}}
Data were analyzed using several methods including a multiple Bayesian linear regression
analysis.
{{}}
The results indicate that ca.
{{}}
33% of variation in developers’ need for cognition can
be explained by personality traits.
{{}}
The Bayesian analysis suggests four traits to be of particular interest in predicting need for cognition:
{{}}
openness to experience, conscientiousness,
honesty-humility, and emotionality.
{{}}
Further, we also find that need for cognition of software
engineers is, on average, higher than in the general population, based on a comparison with
prior studies.
{{}}
Given the importance of human factors for software engineers’ performance in
general, and problem solving skills in particular, our findings suggest several implications
for recruitment, working behavior, and teaming.
