Despite the availability of various methods and tools to facilitate secure coding, developers continue to write
code that contains common vulnerabilities.
{{}}
It is important to understand why technological advances do not
sufficiently facilitate developers in writing secure code.
{{}}
To widen our understanding of developers’ behaviour,
we considered the complexity of the security decision space of developers using theory from cognitive and
social psychology.
{{}}
Our interdisciplinary study reported in this article (1) draws on the psychology literature to
provide conceptual underpinnings for three categories of impediments to achieving security goals, (2) reports
on an in-depth meta-analysis of existing software security literature that identified a catalogue of factors that
influence developers’ security decisions, and (3) characterises the landscape of existing security interventions
that are available to the developer during coding and identifies gaps.
{{}}
Collectively, these show that different
forms of impediments to achieving security goals arise from different contributing factors.
{{}}
Interventions will
be more effective where they reflect psychological factors more sensitively and marry technical sophistication,
psychological frameworks, and usability.
{{}}
Our analysis suggests “adaptive security interventions” as a solution
that responds to the changing security needs of individual developers and a present a proof-of-concept tool
to substantiate our suggestion.
