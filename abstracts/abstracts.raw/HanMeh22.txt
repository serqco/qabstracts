Two N-of-1 self-trials on readability differences between anonymous inner classes (AICs) and lambda expressions (LEs) on Java code snippets.

In Java, lambda expressions (LEs) were introduced at a time where the similar language construct anonymous inner class (AIC) already existed for years.
{{}}
But while LEs became quite
popular in mainstream programming languages in general, their usability is hardly studied.
{{}}
From the Java perspective the need to study the relationship between LEs and AICs was and
is quite obvious, because both language constructs co-exist.
{{}}
However, it is quite usual that
new language constructs are introduced although they are not or hardly studied using scientific methods – and an often heard argument from programming language designers is that
the effort or the costs for the application of the scientific method on language constructs is
too high.
{{}}
The present paper contributes in two different ways.
{{}}
First, with respect to LEs in
comparison to AICs, this paper presents two N-of-1 studies (i.e. randomized control trials
executed on a single subject) where LEs and AICs are used as listeners in Java code.
{{}}
Both
experiments had two similar and rather simple tasks (“count the number of parameters”,
respectively “count the number of used parameters”) with the dependent variable being reaction time.
{{}}
The first experiment used the number of parameters, the second the number of
used parameters as the controlled, independent variable (in addition to the technique LE and
AIC).
{{}}
Other variables (LOC, etc.) were randomly generated within given boundaries.
{{}}
The
main result of both experiments is that LEs without type annotations require less reading
time (p < .01) with rather small effect sizes (ηp2 < .2, reduction of reaction time of at most
35%).
{{}}
The results are based on 9,600 observations (one N-of-1 trial with eight replications).
{{}}
This gives evidence that the readability of LEs without type annotations improves the readability of code.
{{}}
However, the effect seems to be so small, that we do not expect this to have
a larger impact on daily programming.
{{}}
Second, we see the contribution of this paper in the
application of N-of-1 trials.
{{}}
Such experiments require relatively low effort in the data selection but still permit to analyze results in a non-subjective way using commonly accepted
analysis techniques.
{{}}
Additionally, they permit to increase the number of selected data points
in comparison to traditional multi–subject experiments.
{{}}
We think that researchers should
take such experiments into account before planning and executing larger experiments.
