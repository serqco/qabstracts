Sampling in software engineering research: a critical review and guidelines.

Representative sampling appears rare in empirical software engineering research.
{{}}
Not all
studies need representative samples, but a general lack of representative sampling undermines a scientific field.
{{}}
This article therefore reports a critical review of the state of sampling
in recent, high-quality software engineering research.
{{}}
The key findings are:
{{}}
(1) random
sampling is rare; (2) sophisticated sampling strategies are very rare; (3) sampling, representativeness and randomness often appear misunderstood.
{{}}
These findings suggest that
software engineering research has a generalizability crisis.
{{}}
To address these problems,
this paper synthesizes existing knowledge of sampling into a succinct primer and proposes
extensive guidelines for improving the conduct, presentation and evaluation of sampling
in software engineering research.
{{}}
It is further recommended that while researchers should
strive for more representative samples, disparaging non-probability sampling is generally
capricious and particularly misguided for predominately qualitative research.
