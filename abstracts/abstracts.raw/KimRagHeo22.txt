Learning Probabilistic Models for Static Analysis Alarms.

We present BayeSmith, a general framework for automatically
learning probabilistic models of static analysis alarms.
{{}}
Several prob-
abilistic reasoning techniques have recently been proposed which
incorporate external feedback on semantic facts and thereby reduce
the user’s alarm inspection burden.
{{}}
However, these approaches are
fundamentally limited to models with pre-defined structure, and are
therefore unable to learn or transfer knowledge regarding an anal-
ysis from one program to another.
{{}}
Furthermore, these probabilistic
models often aggressively generalize from external feedback and
falsely suppress real bugs.
{{}}
To address these problems, we propose
BayeSmith that learns the structure and weights of the probabilistic
model.
{{}}
Starting from an initial model and a set of training programs
with bug labels, BayeSmith refines the model to effectively priori-
tize real bugs based on feedback.
{{}}
We evaluate the approach with
two static analyses on a suite of C programs.
{{}}
We demonstrate that
the learned models significantly improve the performance of three
state-of-the-art probabilistic reasoning systems.

To deal with the challenges of accuracy and alarm relevance, various
probabilistic program reasoning mechanisms have been proposed
for static program analyzers.
{{}}
Such systems initially report a set of
alarms in the target program using the underlying analysis and com-
pute the probability of each alarm based on a probabilistic model.
{{}}
Then, they prioritize static analysis alarms by incorporating exter-
nal feedback on semantic facts from various sources such as the
users [23, 39, 50], the old version of the program [15], or dynamic
analysis results [5].
{{}}
Upon receiving a response, they generalize
from the feedback and prioritize the remaining alarms depend-
ing on their relevance to those inspected by the user.
{{}}
By rapidly
focusing attention on the real bugs in the target program, these
systems achieve a dramatic improvement in the usability of the
static analyzer.
{{}}
Despite their experimental success, much of this previous re-
search has focused on the problem of inference, rather than on
learning.
{{}}
Existing approaches based on probabilistic reasoning such
as alarm ranking [5, 15, 39] only learn limited forms of transfer-
able knowledge—such as the assignment of weights to the under-
lying probabilistic model—using standard methods such as the
