Knowledge-Based Environment Dependency Inference for Python Programs.

Besides third-party packages, the Python interpreter and system
libraries are also critical dependencies of a Python program.
{{}}
In our
empirical study, 34% programs are only compatible with specific
Python interpreter versions, and 24% programs require specific
system libraries.
{{}}
However, existing techniques mainly focus on
inferring third-party package dependencies.
{{}}
Therefore, they can
lack other necessary dependencies and violate version constraints,
thus resulting in program build failures and runtime errors.
{{}}
This paper proposes a knowledge-based technique named PyEGo,
which can automatically infer dependencies of third-party packages,
the Python interpreter, and system libraries at compatible versions
for Python programs.
{{}}
We first construct the dependency knowl-
edge graph PyKG, which can portray the relations and constraints
among third-party packages, the Python interpreter, and system
libraries.
{{}}
Then, by querying PyKG with extracted program features,
PyEGo constructs a program-related sub-graph with dependency
candidates of the three types.
{{}}
It finally outputs the latest compatible
dependency versions by solving constraints in the sub-graph.
{{}}
We
evaluate PyEGo on 2,891 single-file Python gists, 100 open-source
