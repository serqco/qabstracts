The effects of continuous integration on software development: a systematic literature review.

Context Continuous integration (CI) is a software engineering technique that proclaims frequent activities to assure the software product health.
{{}}
Researchers and practitioners mention
several benefits related to CI.
{{}}
However, no systematic study surveys state of the art regarding
such benefits or cons.
{{}}
Objective This study aims to identify and interpret empirical evidence regarding how CI
impacts software development.
{{}}
Method Through a Systematic Literature Review, we search for studies in six digital
libraries.
{{}}
Starting from 479 studies, we select 101 empirical studies that evaluate CI in the
context of software development.
{{}}
We thoroughly read and extract information regarding (i)
the CI environment, (ii) findings related to the effects of CI, and (iii) the employed research
methods.
{{}}
We apply a thematic synthesis to group and summarize the findings.
{{}}
Results Existing research has explored the positive effects of CI, such as better cooperation,
or negative effects, such as adding technical and process challenges.
{{}}
From our thematic synthesis, we identify six themes:
{{}}
development activities, software process, quality assurance,
integration patterns, issues & defects, and build patterns.
{{}}
Conclusions Empirical research in CI has been increasing over recent years.
{{}}
We found that
much of the existing research reveals that CI brings positive effects to software development.
{{}}
However, CI may also bring technical challenges to software development teams.
{{}}
Despite
the overall positive outlook regarding CI, we still find room for improvements in the existing
empirical research that evaluates the effects of CI.
