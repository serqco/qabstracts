Tests that fail inconsistently, without changes to the code under test, are described as flaky.
{{}}
Flaky tests do
not give a clear indication of the presence of software bugs and thus limit the reliability of the test suites
that contain them.
{{}}
A recent survey of software developers found that 59% claimed to deal with flaky tests
on a monthly, weekly, or daily basis.
{{}}
As well as being detrimental to developers, flaky tests have also been
shown to limit the applicability of useful techniques in software testing research.
{{}}
In general, one can think
of flaky tests as being a threat to the validity of any methodology that assumes the outcome of a test only
depends on the source code it covers.
{{}}
In this article, we systematically survey the body of literature relevant
to flaky test research, amounting to 76 papers.
{{}}
We split our analysis into four parts:
{{}}
addressing the causes of
flaky tests, their costs and consequences, detection strategies, and approaches for their mitigation and repair.
{{}}
Our findings and their implications have consequences for how the software-testing community deals with
test flakiness, pertinent to practitioners and of interest to those wanting to familiarize themselves with the
research area.
