A Practical Approach for Dynamic Taint Tracking with Control-flow Relationships.


Dynamic taint tracking, a technique that traces relationships between values as a program executes, has
been used to support a variety of software engineering tasks.
{{}}
Some taint tracking systems only consider data
flows and ignore control flows.
{{}}
As a result, relationships between some values are not reflected by the analysis.
{{}}
Many applications of taint tracking either benefit from or rely on these relationships being traced, but past
works have found that tracking control flows resulted in over-tainting, dramatically reducing the precision
of the taint tracking system.
{{}}
In this article, we introduce Conflux, alternative semantics for propagating
taint tags along control flows.
{{}}
Conflux aims to reduce over-tainting by decreasing the scope of control
flows and providing a heuristic for reducing loop-related over-tainting.
{{}}
We created a Java implementation
of Conflux and performed a case study exploring the effect of Conflux on a concrete application of taint
tracking, automated debugging.
{{}}
In addition to this case study, we evaluated Conflux’s accuracy using a
novel benchmark consisting of popular, real-world programs.
{{}}
We compared Conflux against existing taint
propagation policies, including a state-of-the-art approach for reducing control-flow-related over-tainting,
finding that Conflux had the highest F1 score on 43 out of the 48 total tests.
