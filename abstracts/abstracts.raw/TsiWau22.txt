A model-driven framework to support strategic agility: Value-added perspective.

Context:
{{}}
The Covid-19 pandemic has shown the entire world that the habits of work, freedom, and consumption can change quickly and significantly for an undetermined amount of time.
{{}}
A dynamic environment as
such, prompts organizations to move fast in order to leverage changing circumstances as sources of opportunity
rather than deadly threats.
{{}}
Drastic changes in work organization, consumption habits, compliance, etc., may
require firms to quickly adopt new technology delivering all sorts of added value.
{{}}
Objective:
{{}}
The development and adoption of new technology – structurally impacting the way the organization
conducts its activities – requires a considerable amount of effort in a short time frame, thus rendering it a
governance decision where the alignment of the technology’s adoption and use to the long term strategy
needs to be evaluated.
{{}}
The short time frame requiring fast response implies that agility should not remain a
development or management/operational concept but should also be adopted onto the strategic layer.
{{}}
Method:
{{}}
Design Science Research (DSR) has been applied to build-up a framework supporting strategic agility
in a model-driven fashion called Strategic Agile Model Driven IT Governance (StratAMoDrIGo).
{{}}
The relevance,
rigor and design cycles of DSR have been applied and presented.
{{}}
Results:
{{}}
StratAMoDrIGo is based on the identification of sources of value for the organization’s strategy, its
stakeholders and the users of the implemented/adopted technology.
{{}}
Relevant concepts are consolidated in an
ontology of which the application uses the NFR Model at strategic-level and the i* Strategic Rationale Model
at management-level.
{{}}
The proposal is applied on the case of an hospital facing the Covid-19 pandemic.
{{}}
Conclusion:
{{}}
The value brought by strategic opportunities’ adoption to the organization, stakeholders and users
can be evaluated ex ante through conceptual models.
