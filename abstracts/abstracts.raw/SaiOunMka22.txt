Detecting Continuous Integration Skip Commits Using Multi-Objective Evolutionary Search.

Continuous Integration (CI) consists of integrating the changes introduced by different developers more frequently through
the automation of build process.
{{}}
Nevertheless, the CI build process is seen as a major barrier that causes delays in the product release
dates.
{{}}
One of the main reasons for such delays is that some simple changes (i.e., can be skipped) trigger the build, which represents
an unnecessary overhead and particularly painful for large projects.
{{}}
In order to cut off the expenses of CI build time, we propose in this
paper, SKIPCI, a novel search-based approach to automatically detect CI Skip commits based on the adaptation of Strength-Pareto
Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA-2).
{{}}
Our approach aims to provide the optimal trade-off between two conflicting objectives to deal with
both skipped and non-skipped commits.
{{}}
We evaluate our approach and investigate the performance of both within and cross-project
validations on a benchmark of 14,294 CI commits from 15 projects that use Travis CI system.
{{}}
The statistical tests revealed that our
approach shows a clear advantage over the baseline approaches with average scores of 92% and 84% in terms of AUC for crossvalidation and cross-project validations respectively.
{{}}
Furthermore, the features analysis reveals that documentation changes, terms
appearing in the commit message and the committer experience are the most prominent features in CI skip detection.
{{}}
When it comes to
the cross-project scenario, the results reveal that besides the documentation changes, there is a strong link between current and
previous commits results.
{{}}
Moreover, we deployed and evaluated the usefulness of SKIPCI with our industrial partner.
{{}}
Qualitative results
demonstrate the effectiveness of SKIPCI in providing relevant CI skip commit recommendations to developers for two large software
projects from practitionerâ€™s point of view.
