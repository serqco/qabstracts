Analysis of a many-objective optimization approach for identifying microservices from legacy systems.

The expensive maintenance of legacy systems leads companies to migrate such systems
to modern architectures.
{{}}
Microservice architectural style has become a trend to modernize monolithic legacy systems.
{{}}
A microservice architecture consists of small, autonomous,
and highly-independent services communicating by using lightweight network protocols.
{{}}
To support the designing of microservice architectures, recent studies have proposed either
single or multi-objective approaches.
{{}}
In order to improve the effectiveness of existing
approaches, we introduced toMicroservices that is a many-objective search-based
approach to aid the identification of boundaries among services.
{{}}
In previous studies, we
have focused on a qualitative evaluation of the applicability and adoption of the proposed
approach from a practical point of view, thus the optimization process itself has not been
investigated in depth.
{{}}
In this paper, we extend our previous work by performing a more indepth analysis of our many-objective approach for microservice identification.
{{}}
We compare
our approach against a baseline approach based on a random search using a set of performance indicators widely used in the literature of many-objective optimization.
{{}}
Our results
are validated through a real-world case study.
{{}}
The study findings reveal that (i) the criteria
optimized by our approach are interdependent and conflicting; and (ii) all candidate solutions lead to better performance indicators in comparison to random search.
{{}}
Overall, the
proposed many-objective approach for microservice identification yields promising results,
which shed light on insights for further improvements.
