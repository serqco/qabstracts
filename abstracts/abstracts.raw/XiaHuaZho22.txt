Search-based Diverse Sampling from Real-world Software Product Lines.

Real-world software product lines (SPLs) often encompass
enormous valid configurations that are impossible to enu-
merate.
{{}}
To understand properties of the space formed by
all valid configurations, a feasible way is to select a smal-
l and valid sample set.
{{}}
Even though a number of sampling
strategies have been proposed, they either fail to produce
diverse samples with respect to the number of selected fea-
tures (an important property to characterize behaviors of
configurations), or achieve diverse sampling but with lim-
ited scalability (the handleable configuration space size is
limited to 1013 ).
{{}}
To resolve this dilemma, we propose a scal-
able diverse sampling strategy, which uses a distance metric
in combination with the novelty search algorithm to produce
diverse samples in an incremental way.
{{}}
The distance metric
is carefully designed to measure similarities between config-
urations, and further diversity of a sample set.
{{}}
The novelty
search incrementally improves diversity of samples through
the search for novel configurations.
{{}}
We evaluate our sam-
pling algorithm on 39 real-world SPLs.
{{}}
It is able to generate
the required number of samples for all the SPLs, including
those which cannot be counted by sharpSAT, a state-of-the-
art model counting solver.
