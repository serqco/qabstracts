Recruiting credible participants for field studies in software engineering research.

Context:
{{}}
Software practitioners are a primary provider of information for field studies in software engineering.
{{}}
Research typically recruits practitioners through some kind of sampling.
{{}}
But sampling may not in itself recruit
the "right" participants.
{{}}
Objective:
{{}}
To assess existing guidance on participant recruitment, and to propose and illustrate a framework
for recruiting professional practitioners as credible participants in field studies of software engineering.
{{}}
Methods:
{{}}
We review existing guidelines, checklists and other advisory sources on recruiting participants for
field studies.
{{}}
We develop a framework, partly based on our prior research and on the research of others.
{{}}
We
search for and select three exemplar studies (a case study, an interview study and a survey study) and use
those to illustrate the framework.
{{}}
Results:
{{}}
Whilst existing guidance recognises the importance of recruiting participants, there is limited guidance
on how to recruit the "right" participants.
{{}}
The framework suggests the conceptualisation of participants as
"research instruments" or, alternatively, as a sampling frame for items of interest.
{{}}
The exemplars suggest
that at least some members of the research community are aware of the need to carefully recruit the "right"
participants.
{{}}
Conclusions:
{{}}
The framework is intended to encourage researchers to think differently about the involvement of
practitioners in field studies of software engineering.
{{}}
Also, the framework identifies a number of characteristics
not explicitly addressed by existing guidelines.
