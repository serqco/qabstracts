Software defect prediction with semantic and structural information of codes based on Graph Neural Networks.

Context:
{{}}
Most defect prediction methods consider a series of traditional manually designed static code metrics.
{{}}
However, only using these hand-crafted features is impractical.
{{}}
Some researchers use the Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) to capture the potential semantic information based on the programâ€™s Syntax Trees (ASTs).
{{}}
In recent years, leveraging the dependency relationships between software modules to construct a software
network and using network embedding models to capture the structural information have been helpful in
defect prediction.
{{}}
This paper simultaneously takes the semantic and structural information into account and
proposes a method called CGCN.
{{}}
Objective:
{{}}
This study aims to validate the feasibility and performance of the proposed method in software
defect prediction.
{{}}
Method:
{{}}
Abstract Syntax Trees and a Class Dependency Network (CDN) are first generated based on the source
code.
{{}}
For ASTs, symbolic tokens are extracted and encoded into vectors.
{{}}
The numerical vectors are then used
as input to the CNN to capture the semantic information.
{{}}
For CDN, a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)
is used to learn the structural information of the network automatically.
{{}}
Afterward, the learned semantic and
structural information are combined with different weights.
{{}}
Finally, we concatenate the learned features with
traditional hand-crafted features to train a classifier for more accurate defect prediction.
{{}}
Results:
{{}}
The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art defect prediction models for both within-project
prediction (including within-version and cross-version) and cross-project prediction on 21 open-source projects.
{{}}
In general, within-version prediction achieves better performance in the three prediction tasks.
{{}}
Conclusion:
{{}}
The proposed method of combining semantic and structural information can improve the
performance of software defect prediction.
