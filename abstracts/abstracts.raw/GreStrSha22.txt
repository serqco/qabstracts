An onboarding model for integrating newcomers into agile project teams.

Context:
{{}}
A stable team is deemed optimal for agile software development project success; however, all teams
change membership over time.
{{}}
Newcomers joining an agile project team must rapidly assimilate into the
organisational and project environment.
{{}}
They must do this while learning how to contribute effectively and
without seriously interrupting project progress.
{{}}
Objective:
{{}}
This paper addresses how newcomers integrate into an established agile project team and how agile
practices assist with onboarding.
{{}}
Method:
{{}}
A single, qualitative case study approach was used, investigating a co-located agile project team in a
large IT department who regularly onboard inexperienced newcomers.
{{}}
Analysis was abductive, consisting of
inductive coding and theming using categories from an existing onboarding theory.
{{}}
Results:
{{}}
We describe the teamâ€™s onboarding practices and adjustments and present an agile onboarding model
that encompasses onboarding activities, individual adjustments, and workplace adjustments.
{{}}
Conclusions:
{{}}
A mixture of general and specific agile onboarding practices contribute to successful onboarding in
an agile team.
{{}}
We provide practical guidelines to improve onboarding practice in agile teams.
{{}}
Our major new
contribution is an extended model of onboarding for agile teams.
