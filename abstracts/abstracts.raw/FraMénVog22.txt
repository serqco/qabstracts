How do Practitioners Perceive the Relevance of Requirements Engineering Research?

Context:
{{}}
The relevance of Requirements Engineering (RE) research to practitioners is vital for a long-term dissemination of
research results to everyday practice.
{{}}
Some authors have speculated about a mismatch between research and practice in the RE
discipline.
{{}}
However, there is not much evidence to support or refute this perception.
{{}}
Objective:
{{}}
This article presents the results of a
study aimed at gathering evidence from practitioners about their perception of the relevance of RE research and at understanding the
factors that influence that perception.
{{}}
Method:
{{}}
We conducted a questionnaire-based survey of industry practitioners with expertise in
RE.
{{}}
The participants rated the perceived relevance of 435 scientific papers presented at five top RE-related conferences.
{{}}
Results:
{{}}
The
153 participants provided a total of 2,164 ratings.
{{}}
The practitioners rated RE research as essential or worthwhile in a majority of cases.
{{}}
However, the percentage of non-positive ratings is still higher than we would like.
{{}}
Among the factors that affect the perception of
relevance are the research's links to industry, the research method used, and respondents' roles.
{{}}
The reasons for positive perceptions
were primarily related to the relevance of the problem and the soundness of the solution, while the causes for negative perceptions
were more varied.
{{}}
The respondents also provided suggestions for future research, including topics researchers have studied for
decades, like elicitation or requirement quality criteria.
{{}}
Conclusions:
{{}}
The study is valuable for both researchers and practitioners.
{{}}
Researchers can use the reasons respondents gave for positive and negative perceptions and the suggested research topics to help
make their research more appealing to practitioners and thus more prone to industry adoption.
{{}}
Practitioners can benefit from the overall
view of contemporary RE research by learning about research topics that they may not be familiar with, and compare their perception
with those of their colleagues to self-assess their positioning towards more academic research.
