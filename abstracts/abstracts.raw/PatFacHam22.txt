The sense of logging in the Linux kernel.

Logging plays a crucial role in software engineering because it is key to perform various
tasks including debugging, performance analysis, and detection of anomalies.
{{}}
Despite the
importance of log data, the practice of logging still suffers from the lack of common guidelines and best practices.
{{}}
Recent studies investigated logging in C/C++ and Java open-source
systems.
{{}}
In this paper, we complement these studies by conducting the first empirical study
on logging practices in the Linux kernel, one of the most elaborate open-source development projects in the computer industry.
{{}}
We analyze 22 Linux releases with a focus on three
main aspects:
{{}}
the pervasiveness of logging in Linux, the types of changes made to logging
statements, and the rationale behind these changes.
{{}}
Our findings show that logging code
accounts for 3.73% of the total source code in the Linux kernel, distributed across 72.36%
of Linux files.
{{}}
We also found that the distribution of logging statements across Linux subsystems and their components vary significantly with no apparent reasons, suggesting that
developers use different criteria when logging.
{{}}
In addition, we observed a slow decrease in
the use of loggingâ€”reduction of 9.27% between versions v4.3 and v5.3.
{{}}
The majority of
changes in logging code are made to fix language issues, modify log levels, and upgrade
logging code to use new logging libraries, with the overall goal of improving the precision
and consistency of the log output.
{{}}
Many recommendations are derived from our findings
such as the use of static analysis tools to detect log-related issues, the adoption of common
writing styles to improve the quality of log messages, the development of conventions to
guide developers when selecting log levels, the establishment of review sessions to review
logging code, and so on.
{{}}
Our recommendations can serve as a basis for developing logging
guidelines as well as better logging processes, tools, and techniques.
