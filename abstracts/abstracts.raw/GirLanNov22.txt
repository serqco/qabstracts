Emotions and Perceived Productivity of Software Developers at the Workplace.

Emotions are known to impact cognitive skills, thus influencing job performance.
{{}}
This is also true for software development,
which requires creativity and problem-solving abilities.
{{}}
In this paper, we report the results of a field study involving professional
developers from five different companies.
{{}}
We provide empirical evidence that a link exists between emotions and perceived productivity
at the workplace.
{{}}
Furthermore, we present a taxonomy of triggers for developers' positive and negative emotions, based on the
qualitative analysis of participants' self-reported answers collected through daily experience sampling.
{{}}
Finally, we experiment with a
minimal set of non-invasive biometric sensors that we use as input for emotion detection.
{{}}
We found that positive emotional valence,
neutral arousal, and high dominance are prevalent.
{{}}
We also found a positive correlation between emotional valence and perceived
productivity, with a stronger correlation in the afternoon.
{{}}
Both social and individual breaks emerge as useful for restoring a positive
mood.
{{}}
Furthermore, we found that a minimum set of non-invasive biometric sensors can be used as a predictor for emotions, provided
that training is performed on an individual basis.
{{}}
While promising, our classifier performance is not yet robust enough for practical
usage.
{{}}
Further data collection is required to strengthen the classifier, by also implementing individual fine-tuning of emotion models.
