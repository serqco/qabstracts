AI-based systems are software systems with functionalities enabled by at least one AI component (e.g., for
image-, speech-recognition, and autonomous driving).
{{}}
AI-based systems are becoming pervasive in society
due to advances in AI.
{{}}
However, there is limited synthesized knowledge on Software Engineering (SE)
approaches for building, operating, and maintaining AI-based systems.
{{}}
To collect and analyze state-of-theart knowledge about SE for AI-based systems, we conducted a systematic mapping study.
{{}}
We considered 248
studies published between January 2010 and March 2020.
{{}}
SE for AI-based systems is an emerging research
area, where more than 2/3 of the studies have been published since 2018.
{{}}
The most studied properties of
AI-based systems are dependability and safety.
{{}}
We identified multiple SE approaches for AI-based systems,
which we classified according to the SWEBOK areas.
{{}}
Studies related to software testing and software quality
are very prevalent, while areas like software maintenance seem neglected.
{{}}
Data-related issues are the most
recurrent challenges.
{{}}
Our results are valuable for:
{{}}
researchers, to quickly understand the state-of-the-art and
learn which topics need more research; practitioners, to learn about the approaches and challenges that SE
entails for AI-based systems; and, educators, to bridge the gap among SE and AI in their curricula.
