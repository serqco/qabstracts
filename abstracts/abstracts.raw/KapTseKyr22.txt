Help me with this: A categorization of open source software problems.

Context:
{{}}
Free and Open Source Software is widely used in the research community and the software industry.
{{}}
In this context, developers come across various issues they need to handle in order to use and create software
responsibly and without causing legal violations.
{{}}
For instance, using open source software that carries a specific
license or how contributions to open source software should be handled are among the issues that need to be
considered.
{{}}
Objective:
{{}}
As practitioners turn primarily to Q&A sites to seek help, it is important to understand which
specific open source software issues they face.
{{}}
In this research, our main objective is to provide a categorization
of open source software problems present in the user questions of the Open Source Stack Exchange site and
perform a meta-analysis on the encountered questions.
{{}}
Method:
{{}}
We have performed a qualitative study analyzing manually 1,500 most popular posts in the Open
Source Stack Exchange site and have mapped them to categories and more generic clusters.
{{}}
The coding task
was performed in iterations with the participation of three of the authors.
{{}}
Agreement was calculated and cases
of disagreement were resolved.
{{}}
Meta-analysis on questions and answers was also performed for discussion
purposes.
{{}}
Results:
{{}}
We have created 26 categories of problems discussed in the Open Source Stack Exchange site, and
grouped them into 6 clusters.
{{}}
Our results show that posts on license texts/conditions and license/copyright
notices are more common, whereas posts on license differences are the most popular in terms of views by
other users.
{{}}
Conclusion:
{{}}
The results can assist any participant of the open source software community to understand
on which basic issues she should focus on to gain a good understanding of open source software.
{{}}
They are
also useful for improving education on open source software and community support using the implications
presented for each category.
