Context:
{{}}
Complying with privacy regulations has taken on new importance with the introduction of the EU’s
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other privacy regulations.

Privacy measures are becoming
a paramount requirement demanding software organizations’ attention as recent privacy breaches such as

In particular, there is a lack of research into the organizational practices and
challenges involved in compliance, particularly for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which represent a

{{}}
Many SMEs use a continuous software engineering (CSE) approach, which
introduces additional adoption and application challenges.

For example, the fast pace of CSE makes it harder
for SMEs that are already more resource constrained to prioritize non-functional requirements such as privacy.

Objective:
{{}}
This paper aims to fill a gap in the under-researched area of continuous compliance with privacy
requirements in practice, by investigating how a continuous practicing SME dealt with GDPR compliance.

Method:
{{}}
Using design science, we conducted an in-depth ethnographically informed study over the span of
