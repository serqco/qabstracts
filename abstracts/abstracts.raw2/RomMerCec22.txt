The state space of Android apps is huge, and its thorough exploration during testing remains a significant
challenge.
{{}}
The best exploration strategy is highly dependent on the features of the app under test.
{{}}
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a machine learning technique that learns the optimal strategy to solve a task by trial
and error, guided by positive or negative reward, rather than explicit supervision.
{{}}
Deep RL is a recent extension of RL that takes advantage of the learning capabilities of neural networks.
{{}}
Such capabilities make Deep
RL suitable for complex exploration spaces such as one of Android apps.
{{}}
However, state-of-the-art, publicly
available tools only support basic, Tabular RL.
{{}}
We have developed ARES, a Deep RL approach for black-box
testing of Android apps.
{{}}
Experimental results show that it achieves higher coverage and fault revelation than
the baselines, including state-of-the-art tools, such as TimeMachine and Q-Testing.
{{}}
We also investigated the
reasons behind such performance qualitatively, and we have identified the key features of Android apps that
make Deep RL particularly effective on them to be the presence of chained and blocking activities.
{{}}
Moreover,
we have developed FATE to fine-tune the hyperparameters of Deep RL algorithms on simulated apps, since
it is computationally expensive to carry it out on real apps.
