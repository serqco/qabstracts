Toward successful DevSecOps in software development organizations: A decision-making framework.

Context:
{{}}
Development and Operations (DevOps) is a methodology that aims to establish collaboration between
programmers and operators to automate the continuous delivery of new software to reduce the development life
cycle and produce quality software.
{{}}
Development, Security, and Operations (DevSecOps) is developing the
DevOps concept, which integrates security methods into a DevOps process.
{{}}
DevSecOps is a software development
process where security is built in to ensure application confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
{{}}
Objective:
{{}}
This paper aims to identify and prioritize the challenges associated with implementing the DevSecOps
process.
{{}}
Method:
{{}}
We performed a multivocal literature review (MLR) and conducted a questionnaire-based survey to
identify challenges associated with DevSecOps-based projects.
{{}}
Moreover, interpretive structure modeling (ISM)
was applied to study the relationships among the core categories of the challenges.
{{}}
Finally, we used the fuzzy
technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) to prioritize the identified challenges
associated with DevSecOps projects.
{{}}
Results:
{{}}
We identified 18 challenges for the DevSecOps process and mapped them to 10 core categories.
{{}}
The ISM
results indicate that the "standards" category has the most decisive influence on the other nine core categories of
the identified challenges.
{{}}
Moreover, the fuzzy TOPSIS indicates that "lack of secure coding standards,"� "lack of
automated testing tools for security in DevOps,"� and "ignorance in static testing for security due to lack of
knowledge"� are the highest priority challenges for the DevSecOps paradigm.
{{}}
Conclusion:
{{}}
Organizations using DevOps should consider the identified challenges in developing secure software.
