A Common Terminology for Software Risk Management.


In order to improve and sustain their competitiveness over time, organisations nowadays need to undertake
different initiatives to adopt frameworks, models and standards that will allow them to align and improve
their business processes.
{{}}
In spite of these efforts, organisations may still encounter governance and management problems.
{{}}
This is where Risk Management (RM) can play a major role, since its purpose is to
contribute to the creation and preservation of value in the context of the organisation's processes.
{{}}
RM is a
complex and subjective activity that requires experience and a high level of knowledge about risks, and it is
for this reason that standardisation institutions and researchers have made great efforts to define initiatives
to overcome these challenges.
{{}}
However, the RM field nevertheless presents a lack of uniformity in its terms
and concepts, due to the different contexts and scopes of application, a situation that can generate ambiguities and misunderstandings.
{{}}
To address these issues, this paper aims to present an ontology called SRMO
(Software Risk Management Ontology), which seeks to unify the terms and concepts associated with RM
and provide an integrated and holistic view of risk.
{{}}
In doing so, the Pipeline framework has been applied
in order to assure and verify the quality of the proposed ontology, and it has been implemented in Protégé
and validated by means of competency questions.
{{}}
Three application scenarios of this ontology demonstrating
their usefulness in the software engineering field are presented in this paper.
{{}}
We believe that this ontology
can be useful for organisations that are interested in: (i) establishing an RM strategy from an integrated approach,
(ii) defining the elements that help to identify risks and the criteria that support decision-making in
risk assessment, and (iii) helping the involved stakeholders during the process of risk management.
