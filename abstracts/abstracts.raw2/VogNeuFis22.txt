MICOSE4aPS: Industrially Applicable Maturity Metric to Improve Systematic Reuse of Control Software.


automated Production Systems (aPS) are highly complex, mechatronic systems that usually have to operate reliably for many decades.
{{}}
Standardization and reuse of control software modules is a core prerequisite
to achieve the required system quality in increasingly shorter development cycles.
{{}}
However, industrial case
studies in aPS show that many aPS companies still struggle with strategically reusing software.
{{}}
This paper
proposes a metric-based approach to objectively measure the maturity of industrial IEC 61131-based
control software in aPS (MICOSE4aPS) to identify potential weaknesses and quality issues hampering
systematic reuse.
{{}}
Module developers in the machine and plant manufacturing industry can directly benefit
as the metric calculation is integrated into the software engineering workflow.
{{}}
An in-depth industrial evaluation in a top-ranked machine manufacturing company in food packaging and an expert evaluation with
different companies confirmed the benefit of efficiently managing the quality of control software.
