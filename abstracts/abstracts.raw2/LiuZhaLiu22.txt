Context2Vector: Accelerating security event triage via context representation learning.

Context:
{{}}
Security teams are overwhelmed by thousands of alerts and events everyday, which are comprehensively collected for threat analysis in security operations center.
{{}}
Although methods based on rules, intelligence
and data mining are utilized, the alert fatigue situation is still a challenging problem, slowing down the overall
threat investigation process.
{{}}
Objective:
{{}}
'Event polysemy' phenomenon broadly exists in large-scale event dataset, which means that events
of the same category can reveal different purposes in different contexts.
{{}}
This paper aims at exploring, revealing
and evaluating the latent patterns embedding in the event contexts, to gain insight on context semantics and
reduce manual intervention in event triage tasks.
{{}}
Method:
{{}}
A context representation learning based method, named Context2Vector, is proposed.
{{}}
Contexts
are extracted from multiple behavioral views.
{{}}
Then, both dense event representations and sparse topic
representations are learnt at the same time and in the same space.
{{}}
A human-in-the-loop topic annotation
process is involved and finally, a context deviation detection based method is integrated to generate explainable
and informative labels for automated context semantic decoding.
{{}}
Results:
{{}}
Various experiments are conducted on a enterprise-scale event dataset.
{{}}
The topic annotation, context
related feature importance and top-N event ranking evaluation results show that Context2Vector outperforms
traditional methods on the high-risk event identification problems, improving the attacker recall rate by up to
2.25 times within limited events to be investigated.
{{}}
Conclusion:
{{}}
It is concluded that event contexts imply practicable and abundant information in regard to
behaviors and intents of real threat actors.
{{}}
More precise profiling of network entities can be extracted from
contexts, compared to rules, intelligence, and anomaly detectors used in practice.
