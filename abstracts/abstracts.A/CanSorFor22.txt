Patchworking: Exploring the code changes induced by vulnerability fixing activities.

Context:
{{h-background}}
Identifying and repairing vulnerable code is a critical software maintenance task.
{{background}}
Change impact
analysis plays an important role during software maintenance, as it helps software maintainers to figure out
the potential effects of a change before it is applied.
{{background}}
However, while the software engineering community
has extensively studied techniques and tools for performing impact analysis of change requests, there are no
approaches for estimating the impact when the change involves the resolution of a vulnerability bug.
{{gap}}
Objective:
{{h-objective}}
We hypothesize that similar vulnerabilities may present similar strategies for patching.
{{objective:u1}}
More
specifically, our work aims at understanding whether the class of the vulnerability to fix may determine the
type of impact on the system to repair.
{{objective}}
Method:
{{h-method}}
To verify our conjecture, in this paper, we examine 524 security patches applied to vulnerabilities
belonging to ten different weakness categories and extracted from 98 different open-source projects written in
Java.
{{method}}
Results:
{{h-result}}
We obtain empirical evidence that vulnerabilities of the same types are often resolved by applying
similar code transformations, and, thus, produce almost the same impact on the codebase.
{{result:i1}}
Conclusion:
{{h-conclusion}}
On the one hand, our findings open the way to better management of software maintenance
activities when dealing with software vulnerabilities.
{{conclusion}}
Indeed, vulnerability class information could be exploited
to better predict how much code will be affected by the fixing, how the structural properties of the code (i.e.,
complexity, coupling, cohesion, size) will change, and the effort required for the fix.

On the other hand, our
results can be leveraged for improving automated strategies supporting developers when they have to deal
with security flaws.

The use of singular vs. plural for the headings in structured abstracts may be 
interesting to review. The present article uses Method (singular) and 
Results (plural) although only 1 result is mentioned (at least as formulated).
