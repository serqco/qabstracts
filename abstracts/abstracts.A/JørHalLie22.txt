Context:
{{}}
The mean magnitude of relative error (MMRE) is an error measure frequently used to evaluate and compare the estimation performance of prediction models
and software professionals.
{{}}
Objective:
{{}}
This paper examines conditions for proper use of MMRE in effort estimation contexts.
{{}}
Method:
{{}}
We apply research on scoring functions to identify the type of estimates that minimizes the expected value of the MMRE.
{{}}
Results:
{{}}
We show that the MMRE is a proper error measure for estimates of the most likely (mode) effort, but not for estimates of the median or mean effort, provided
that the effort usage is approximately log-normally distributed, which we argue is a reasonable assumption in many software development contexts.
{{}}
The relevance of
the findings is demonstrated on real-world software development data.
{{}}
Conclusion:
{{}}
MMRE is not a proper measure of the accuracy of estimates of the median or mean effort, but may be used for the accuracy evaluation of estimates of most
likely effort.
