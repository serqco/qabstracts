Epistemology

In parallel to academic (peer-reviewed) literature (e.g., journal and conference papers), an enormous extent of
grey literature (GL) has accumulated since the inception of software engineering (SE).
{{}}
GL is often defined as
“literature that is not formally published in sources such as books or journal articles”, e.g., in the form of trade
magazines, online blog-posts, technical reports, and online videos such as tutorial and presentation videos.
{{}}
GL is
typically produced by SE practitioners.
{{}}
We have observed that researchers are increasingly using and benefitting
from the knowledge available within GL.
{{}}
Related to the notion of GL is the notion of Multivocal Literature
Reviews (MLRs) in SE, i.e., a MLR is a form of a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) which includes knowledge
and/or evidence from the GL in addition to the peer-reviewed literature.
{{}}
MLRs are useful for both researchers
and practitioners because they provide summaries of both the state-of-the-art and -practice in a given area.
{{}}
MLRs
are popular in other fields and have started to appear in SE community.
{{}}
It is timely then for a Special Issue (SI)
focusing on GL and MLRs in SE.
{{}}
From the pool of 13 submitted papers, and after following a rigorous peer review
process, seven papers were accepted for this SI.
{{}}
In this introduction we provide a brief overview of GL and MLRs
in SE, and then a brief summary of the seven papers published in this SI.

Grey literature and its state of in software engineering
While a hazy definition of "grey literature" had existed previously,
the term is generally understood to have been coined by the researcher
Charles P.
{{}}
Auger, who wrote Use of Reports Literature in 1975 [1].
{{}}
Auger [1] referred to literature comprising intelligence reports and
notes on defence research that had been produced, in vast quantities, by
the Allied Forces during World War II.
{{}}
Auger first used the term "grey
literature" during a conference held by the British Lending Library Di­
vision in 1978 [2].
{{}}
The most widely used and accepted definition of “grey literature”
(GL) is the so-called Luxembourg definition, which states that, “[grey
literature] is produced on all levels of government, academics, business
and industry in print and electronic formats, but which is not controlled
by commercial publishers, i.e., where publishing is not the primary ac­
tivity of the producing body” [3].
{{}}
The Cochrane handbook for system­
atic reviews of interventions [4] defines GL as “literature that is not
formally published in sources such as books or journal articles”.
{{}}
Various models have been proposed to classify different types of
sources of GL.
{{}}
For example, one model from the management sciences
[5] organizes GL into three tiers:
{{}}
• 1st tier GL (High outlet control/ High credibility):
{{}}
Such as books,
magazines, government reports, white papers
