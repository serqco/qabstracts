Challenges and solutions when adopting DevSecOps: A systematic review.

Context:
{{h-background}}
DevOps (Development and Operations) has become one of the fastest-growing software development
paradigms in the industry.
{{background}}
However, this trend has presented the challenge of ensuring secure software delivery
while maintaining the agility of DevOps.
{{background}}
The efforts to integrate security in DevOps have resulted in the
DevSecOps paradigm, which is gaining significant interest from both industry and academia.
{{background}}
However, the
adoption of DevSecOps in practice is proving to be a challenge.
{{gap}}
Objective:
{{h-objective}}
This study aims to systemize the knowledge about the challenges faced by practitioners when
adopting DevSecOps and the proposed solutions reported in the literature.
{{objective}}
We also aim to identify the areas
that need further research in the future.
{{objective}}
Method:
{{h-method}}
We conducted a Systematic Literature Review of 54 peer-reviewed studies.
{{method}}
The thematic analysis
method was applied to analyze the extracted data.
{{method}}
Results:
{{h-result}}
We identified 21 challenges related to adopting DevSecOps, 31 specific solutions, and the mapping
between these findings.
{{result}}
We also determined key gap areas in this domain by holistically evaluating the
available solutions against the challenges.
{{result:i1}}
The results of the study were classified into four themes:
{{result}}
People,
Practices, Tools, and Infrastructure.
{{result}}
Our findings demonstrate that tool-related challenges and solutions were
the most frequently reported, driven by the need for automation in this paradigm.
{{conclusion}}
Shift-left security and
continuous security assessment were two key practices recommended for DevSecOps.
{{result}}
People-related factors
were considered critical for successful DevSecOps adoption but less studied.
{{result:i1}}
Conclusions:
{{h-conclusion}}
We highlight the need for developer-centered application security testing tools that target the
continuous practices in DevSecOps.
{{summary}}
More research is needed on how the traditionally manual security practices
can be automated to suit rapid software deployment cycles.
{{fneed}}
Finally, achieving a suitable balance between the
speed of delivery and security is a significant issue practitioners face in the DevSecOps paradigm.
