Time-travel Investigation: Toward Building a Scalable Attack Detection Framework on Ethereum.


Ethereum has been attracting lots of attacks, hence there is a pressing need to perform timely investigation
and detect more attack instances.
{{background}}
However, existing systems suffer from the scalability issue due to the following reasons.
{{gap}}
First, the tight coupling between malicious contract detection and blockchain data importing
makes them infeasible to repeatedly detect different attacks.
{{gap}}
Second, the coarse-grained archive data makes
them inefficient to replay transactions.
{{gap}}
Third, the separation between malicious contract detection and runtime state recovery consumes lots of storage.
{{gap}}
In this article, we propose a scalable attack detection framework named EthScope, which overcomes the
scalability issue by neatly re-organizing the Ethereum state and efficiently locating suspicious transactions.
{{objective}}
It
leverages the fine-grained state to support the replay of arbitrary transactions and proposes a well-designed
schema to optimize the storage consumption.
{{design}}
The performance evaluation shows that EthScope can solve the
scalability issue, i.e., efficiently performing a large-scale analysis on billions of transactions, and a speedup of
around 2,300Ã— when replaying transactions.
{{result:i1}}
It also has lower storage consumption compared with existing
systems.
{{result:i1}}
Further analysis shows that EthScope can help analysts understand attack behaviors and detect
more attack instances.
