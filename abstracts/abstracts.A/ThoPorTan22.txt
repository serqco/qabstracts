AutoTransform: Automated Code Transformation to Support Modern Code Review Process.

Code review is effective, but human-intensive (e.g., developers need
to manually modify source code until it is approved).
{{}}
Recently, prior
work proposed a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) approach to
automatically transform source code to the version that is reviewed
and approved (i.e., the after version).
{{}}
Yet, its performance is still
suboptimal when the after version has new identifiers or liter-
als (e.g., renamed variables) or has many code tokens.
{{}}
To address
these limitations, we propose AutoTransform which leverages
a Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) approach to handle new tokens and a
Transformer-based NMT architecture to handle long sequences.
{{}}
We
evaluate our approach based on 14,750 changed methods with and
without new tokens for both small and medium sizes.
{{}}
The results
show that when generating one candidate for the after version (i.e.,
beam width = 1), our AutoTransform can correctly transform
1,413 changed methods, which is 567% higher than the prior work,
highlighting the substantial improvement of our approach for code
transformation in the context of code review.
{{}}
This work contributes
towards automated code transformation for code reviews, which
could help developers reduce their effort in modifying source code
during the code review process.

Code review is one of the important quality assurance practices
in a software development process.
{{}}
One of the main goals of code
review is to ensure that the quality of newly developed code meets
a standard before integrating into the main software repository [11,
37].
{{}}
Hence, in the code review process, new source code written by
a code author has to be examined and revised until reviewers (i.e.,
developers other than a code author) agree that this source code is of
∗A   corresponding author.
