Static detection of equivalent mutants in real-time model-based mutation testing.

Model-based mutation testing has the potential to effectively drive test generation to reveal
faults in software systems.
{{background}}
However, it faces a typical efficiency issue since it could produce
many mutants that are equivalent to the original system model, making it impossible to generate test cases from them.
{{background}}
We consider this problem when model-based mutation testing is
applied to real-time system product lines, represented as timed automata.
{{background}}
We define novel,
time-specific mutation operators and formulate the equivalent mutant problem in the frame
of timed refinement relations.
{{objective}}
Further, we study in which cases a mutation yields an equivalent mutant.
{{objective}}
Our theoretical results provide guidance to system engineers, allowing them
to eliminate mutations from which no test case can be produced.
{{conclusion}}
Our empirical evaluation,
based on a proof-of-concept implementation and a set of benchmarks from the literature,
confirms the validity of our theory and demonstrates that in general our approach can avoid
the generation of a significant amount of the equivalent mutants.
