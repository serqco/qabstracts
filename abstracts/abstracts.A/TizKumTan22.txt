Fairness-aware Configuration of Machine Learning Libraries.

This paper investigates the parameter space of machine learning
(ML) algorithms in aggravating or mitigating fairness bugs.
{{}}
Data-
driven software is increasingly applied in social-critical applications
where ensuring fairness is of paramount importance.
{{}}
The existing
approaches focus on addressing fairness bugs by either modify-
ing the input dataset or modifying the learning algorithms.
{{}}
On
the other hand, the selection of hyperparameters, which provide
finer controls of ML algorithms, may enable a less intrusive ap-
proach to influence the fairness.
{{}}
Can hyperparameters amplify or
suppress discrimination present in the input dataset?
{{}}
How can we
help programmers in detecting, understanding, and exploiting the role
of hyperparameters to improve the fairness?
{{}}
We design three search-based software testing algorithms to un-
cover the precision-fairness frontier of the hyperparameter space.
{{}}
We complement these algorithms with statistical debugging to ex-
plain the role of these parameters in improving fairness.
{{}}
We imple-
ment the proposed approaches in the tool Parfait-ML (PARameter
FAIrness Testing for ML Libraries) and show its effectiveness and
utility over five mature ML algorithms as used in six social-critical
applications.
{{}}
In these applications, our approach successfully iden-
tified hyperparameters that significantly improve (vis-a-vis the
state-of-the-art techniques) the fairness without sacrificing preci-
sion.
{{}}
Surprisingly, for some algorithms (e.g., random forest), our
approach showed that certain configuration of hyperparameters
(e.g., restricting the search space of attributes) can amplify biases
across applications.
{{}}
Upon further investigation, we found intuitive
explanations of these phenomena, and the results corroborate simi-
lar observations from the literature.
