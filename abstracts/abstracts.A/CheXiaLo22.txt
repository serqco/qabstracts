Defining Smart Contract Defects on Ethereum.


The selfdestruct function is provided by Ethereum smart contracts to destroy a contract on the blockchain
system.
{{background}}
However, it is a double-edged sword for developers.
{{background}}
On the one hand, using the selfdestruct function
enables developers to remove smart contracts (SCs) from Ethereum and transfers Ethers when emergency
situations happen, e.g., being attacked.
{{background}}
On the other hand, this function can increase the complexity for the
development and open an attack vector for attackers.
{{background}}
To better understand the reasons why SC developers include or exclude the selfdestruct function in their contracts, we conducted an online survey to collect feedback
from them and summarize the key reasons.
{{objective,method}}
Their feedback shows that 66.67% of the developers will deploy
an updated contract to the Ethereum after destructing the old contract.
{{result}}
According to this information, we
propose a method to find the self-destructed contracts (also called predecessor contracts) and their updated
version (successor contracts) by computing the code similarity.
{{design}}
By analyzing the difference between the predecessor contracts and their successor contracts, we found five reasons that led to the death of the contracts;
two of them (i.e., Unmatched ERC20 Token and Limits of Permission) might affect the life span of contracts.
{{method,result}}
We
developed a tool named LifeScope to detect these problems.
{{design}}
LifeScope reports 0 false positives or negatives in
detecting Unmatched ERC20 Token.
{{result}}
In terms of Limits of Permission, LifeScope achieves 77.89% of F-measure
and 0.8673 of AUC in average.
{{result}}
According to the feedback of developers who exclude selfdestruct functions,
we propose suggestions to help developers use selfdestruct functions in Ethereum smart contracts better.

This article contains five individual studies: (1) an online survey on reasons to include or exclude a selfdestruct function, (2) a method to find self-destructed contracts and their successors, (3) an analysis of difference between those contracts, (4) a tool to detect problems incentivizing selfdestruction, and (5) an empirical evaluation of that tool.
