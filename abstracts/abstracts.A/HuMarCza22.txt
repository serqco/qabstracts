If a Human Can See It, So Should Your System: Reliability Requirements for Machine Vision Components.

Machine Vision Components (MVC) are becoming safety-critical.
{{background}}
Assuring their quality, including safety, is essential for their suc-
cessful deployment.
{{background}}
Assurance relies on the availability of precisely
specified and, ideally, machine-verifiable requirements.
{{background}}
MVCs with
state-of-the-art performance rely on machine learning (ML) and
training data, but largely lack such requirements.
{{gap}}
In this paper, we address the need for defining machine-verifiable
reliability requirements for MVCs against transformations that sim-
ulate the full range of realistic and safety-critical changes in the
environment.
{{objective}}
Using human performance as a baseline, we define re-
liability requirements as:
{{design}}
'if the changes in an image do not affect a
human's decision, neither should they affect the MVC's.'
{{design}}
To this end, we provide:
{{design}}
(1) a class of safety-related image transformations; (2)
reliability requirement classes to specify correctness-preservation
and prediction-preservation for MVCs; (3) a method to instantiate
machine-verifiable requirements from these requirements classes
using human performance experiment data; (4) human performance
experiment data for image recognition involving eight commonly
used transformations, from about 2000 human participants; and
(5) a method for automatically checking whether an MVC satisfies
our requirements.
{{design}}
Further, we show that our reliability require-
ments are feasible and reusable by evaluating our methods on 13
state-of-the-art pre-trained image classification models.
{{result,method}}
Finally, we
demonstrate that our approach detects reliability gaps in MVCs
that other existing methods are unable to detect.

Sentence 9 is a very large and hairy sentence.
