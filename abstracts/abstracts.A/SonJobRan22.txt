Mining Similar Methods for Test Adaptation.

Developers may choose to implement a library despite the existence of similar libraries, considering factors such as
computational performance, language or platform dependency, accuracy, convenience, and completeness of an API.
{{background}}
As a result,
GitHub hosts several library projects that have overlaps in their functionalities.
{{background}}
These overlaps have been of interest to developers from
the perspective of code reuse or the preference of one implementation over the other.
{{background}}
Through an empirical study, we explore the extent
and nature of existence of these similarities in the library functions.
{{objective}}
We have further studied whether the similarity of functions across
different libraries and their associated test suites can be leveraged to reveal defects in one another.
{{objective}}
We see scope for effectively using
the mining of test suites from the perspective of revealing defects in a program or its documentation.
{{result}}
Another noteworthy observation
made in the study is that similar functions may exist across libraries implemented in the same language as well as in different
languages.
{{result}}
Identifying the challenges that lie in building a testing tool, we automate the entire process in METALLICUS, a test mining and
recommendation tool.
{{design}}
METALLICUS returns a test suite for the given input of a query function and a template for its test suite.
{{design}}
On a dataset
of query functions taken from libraries implemented in Java or Python, METALLICUS revealed 46 defects.
