Context:
{{}}
Software reliability prediction in the early stages of development can be propitious in many ways.
{{}}
The
combinatorial models used to predict reliability using architectures such as fault trees, binary decision diagrams,
etc.
{{}}
have limitations in modeling complex system behavior.
{{}}
On the other hand, state-based models such as
Markov chains suffer from the state-space explosion problem, and they need transition probability among
different system states to measure reliability.
{{}}
These probabilities are usually assumed or are obtained from the
operational profile for which the system should be used in the field.
{{}}
Objective:
{{}}
The objective of this paper is to present a method for predicting the reliability of software in industrial
systems using a generalized stochastic Petri nets based approach.
{{}}
The key idea is to violate the assumption of
state transition probabilities in the Markov chain.
{{}}
The state transition probabilities are calculated using Petri net
transitions’ throughput by performing stationary analysis under the consideration to identify and handle dead
markings in the Petri net.
{{}}
Method:
{{}}
Initially, a generalized stochastic Petri net of the system under consideration is generated from the
standard system’s specification.
{{}}
Thereafter, dead markings are identified in the Petri net which are further
removed to perform steady-state analysis.
{{}}
At last, a Markov model is generated based on the reachability graph of
the Petri net, which is further used to predict the system reliability.
{{}}
Results:
{{}}
The presented method has been applied to a safety-critical system, Shut Down System-1, of a nuclear
power plant, which is operational in the Canada Deuterium Uranium reactor.
{{}}
The predicted reliability of the
system using this method is 99.99966% which has been validated using the specified system requirements.
{{}}
To
further validate and generalize the results, sensitivity analysis is performed by varying different system
parameters.
{{}}
Conclusions:
{{}}
The method discussed in this paper presents a step of performing structural analysis on the Petri net
of the system under consideration to identify and handle dead markings on the Petri net.
{{}}
It further handles the
issue of assuming transition probabilities among the system states by calculating them using Petri net transitions’
throughput.
