Green AI: Do Deep Learning Frameworks Have Different Costs?

The use of Artificial Intelligence (ai), and more specifically of Deep
Learning (dl), in modern software systems, is nowadays widespread
and continues to grow.
{{background}}
At the same time, its usage is energy de-
manding and contributes to the increased CO2 emissions, and has
a great financial cost as well.
{{background}}
Even though there are many studies
that examine the capabilities of dl, only a few focus on its green
aspects, such as energy consumption.
{{gap}}
This paper aims at raising awareness of the costs incurred when
using different dl frameworks.
{{objective}}
To this end, we perform a thor-
ough empirical study to measure and compare the energy con-
sumption and run-time performance of six different dl models
written in the two most popular dl frameworks, namely PyTorch
and TensorFlow.
{{method:hype}}
We use a well-known benchmark of dl models,
DeepLearningExamples, created by nvidia, to compare both the
training and inference costs of dl.
{{method}}
Finally, we manually investigate
the functions of these frameworks that took most of the time to
execute in our experiments.
{{method}}
The results of our empirical study reveal that there is a statisti-
cally significant difference between the cost incurred by the two
dl frameworks in 94% of the cases studied.
{{result}}
While TensorFlow
achieves significantly better energy and run-time performance than
PyTorch, and with large effect sizes in 100% of the cases for the
training phase, PyTorch instead exhibits significantly better en-
ergy and run-time performance than TensorFlow in the inference
phase for 66% of the cases, always, with large effect sizes.
{{result}}
Such a
large difference in performance costs does not, however, seem to
affect the accuracy of the models produced, as both frameworks
achieve comparable scores under the same configurations.
{{result}}
Our man-
ual analysis, of the documentation and source code of the functions
examined, reveals that such a difference in performance costs is
under-documented, in these frameworks.
{{method:i1,result}}
This suggests that devel-
opers need to improve the documentation of their dl frameworks,
the source code of the functions used in these frameworks, as well
as to enhance existing dl algorithms.

depends a lot on wording. Semantically, the difference is often unclear.
