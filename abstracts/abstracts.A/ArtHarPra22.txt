Nessie: Automatically Testing JavaScript APIs with Asynchronous Callbacks.

Previous algorithms for feedback-directed unit test generation iter-
atively create sequences of API calls by executing partial tests and
by adding new API calls at the end of the test.
{{}}
These algorithms
are challenged by a popular class of APIs:
{{}}
higher-order functions
that receive callback arguments, which often are invoked asyn-
chronously.
{{}}
Existing test generators cannot effectively test such
APIs because they only sequence API calls, but do not nest one call
into the callback function of another.
{{}}
This paper presents Nessie,
the first feedback-directed unit test generator that supports nesting
of API calls and that tests asynchronous callbacks.
{{}}
Nesting API calls
enables a test to use values produced by an API that are available
only once a callback has been invoked, and is often necessary to
ensure that methods are invoked in a specific order.
{{}}
The core con-
tributions of our approach are a tree-based representation of unit
tests with callbacks and a novel algorithm to iteratively generate
such tests in a feedback-directed manner.
{{}}
We evaluate our approach
on ten popular JavaScript libraries with both asynchronous and
synchronous callbacks.
{{}}
The results show that, in a comparison with
LambdaTester, a state of the art test generation technique that only
considers sequencing of method calls, Nessie finds more behavioral
differences and achieves slightly higher coverage.
{{}}
Notably, Nessie
needs to generate significantly fewer tests to achieve and exceed
the coverage achieved by the state of the art.
