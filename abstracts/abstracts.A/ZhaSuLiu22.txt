The large demand of mobile devices creates significant concerns about the quality of mobile applications
(apps).
{{}}
Developers heavily rely on bug reports in issue tracking systems to reproduce failures (e.g., crashes).
{{}}
However, the process of crash reproduction is often manually done by developers, making the resolution
of bugs inefficient, especially given that bug reports are often written in natural language.
{{}}
To improve the
productivity of developers in resolving bug reports, in this paper, we introduce a novel approach, called
ReCDroid+, that can automatically reproduce crashes from bug reports for Android apps.
{{}}
ReCDroid+ uses
a combination of natural language processing (NLP), deep learning, and dynamic GUI exploration to
synthesize event sequences with the goal of reproducing the reported crash.
{{}}
We have evaluated ReCDroid+
on 66 original bug reports from 37 Android apps.
{{}}
The results show that ReCDroid+ successfully reproduced
42 crashes (63.6% success rate) directly from the textual description of the manually reproduced bug reports.
{{}}
A user study involving 12 participants demonstrates that ReCDroid+ can improve the productivity of
developers when resolving crash bug reports.
