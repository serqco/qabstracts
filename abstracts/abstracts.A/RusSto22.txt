Gender Differences in Personality Traits of Software Engineers.

There is a growing body of gender studies in software engineering to understand diversity and inclusion issues, as diversity
is recognized to be a key issue to healthy teams and communities.

A second factor often linked to team performance is personality,
which has received far more attention.
{{background}}
Very few studies, however, have focused on the intersection of these two fields.

Hence, we set
out to study gender differences in personality traits of software engineers.
{{objective}}
Through a survey study we collected personality data, using
the HEXACO model, of 483 software engineers.
{{method}}
The data were analyzed using a Bayesian independent sample t-test and network
analysis.
{{method:u1}}
The results suggest that women score significantly higher in Openness to Experience, Honesty-Humility, and Emotionality
than men.
{{result:i3}}
Further, men show higher psychopathic traits than women.
{{result:i1}}
Based on these findings, we develop a number of propositions
that can guide future research.
