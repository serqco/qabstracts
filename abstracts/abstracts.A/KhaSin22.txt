Context:
{{}}
Recent years have witnessed the growing trend in cross-project defect prediction (CPDP), where the
training and the testing data come from different projects having different data distributions.
{{}}
Several CPDP
methods have been presented in the literature to overcome differences in their distributions, but the majority of
the existing approaches have been evaluated considering the availability of unlimited inspection effort, which is
practically impossible, thus leading to fallacious conclusions.
{{}}
Further, they focused more on improving Recall
over Precision leading to a high probability of false alarm (PF), causing significant wastage of developer’s efforts
and time.
{{}}
Objective:
{{}}
Addressing these issues, we propose a Two-Phase Transfer Boosting (TPTB) model, which aims at
improving the performance not only in terms of non-effort based measures (NEBMs) (making a balance between
Recall and PF) but also in terms of effort based measures (EBMs), considering the availability of limited in­
spection effort.
{{}}
Method:
{{}}
To mitigate the distribution differences, the first phase assigns initial weights to the training modules
based on the feature distribution and feature importance.
{{}}
The second phase applies the Dynamic Transfer
AdaBoost algorithm to build an ensemble classifier to lessen the impact of contradictory training modules.
{{}}
In
addition, a sorting strategy is designed to prioritize the modules for further inspection.
{{}}
Results:
{{}}
Statistical results on 62 datasets revealed a better-balanced performance of our TPTB model holistically
over NN-filter, ManualDown, EASC, and Cruz model with performance comparable to WPDP (Within-project
defect prediction) considering NEBMs.
{{}}
Besides, when considering EBMs together, TPTB showed statistically and
practically more balanced performance as compared to ManualUP and Cruz with overall performance compa­
rable to EASC.
{{}}
Conclusions:
{{}}
Our results demonstrate the efficacy of the TPTB model in a practical setting empowering the quality
assurance team to predict and prioritize the defective modules allocating limited inspection effort by optimally
focusing on highly defective modules.
