Modern application stores enable developers to classify their apps by choosing from a set of generic categories,
or genres, such as health, games, and music.
{{}}
These categories are typically staticâ€”new categories do not necessarily emerge over time to reflect innovations in the mobile software landscape.
{{}}
With thousands of apps
classified under each category, locating apps that match a specific consumer interest can be a challenging task.
{{}}
To overcome this challenge, in this article, we propose an automated approach for classifying mobile apps into
more focused categories of functionally related application domains.
{{}}
Our aim is to enhance apps visibility and
discoverability.
{{}}
Specifically, we employ word embeddings to generate numeric semantic representations of
app descriptions.
{{}}
These representations are then classified to generate more cohesive categories of apps.
{{}}
Our
empirical investigation is conducted using a dataset of 600 apps, sampled from the Education, Health&Fitness,
and Medical categories of the Apple App Store.
{{}}
The results show that our classification algorithms achieve
their best performance when app descriptions are vectorized using GloVe, a count-based model of word embeddings.
{{}}
Our findings are further validated using a dataset of Sharing Economy apps and the results are
evaluated by 12 human subjects.
{{}}
The results show that GloVe combined with Support Vector Machines can
produce app classifications that are aligned to a large extent with human-generated classifications.
