Demystifying regular expression bugs.

Regular expressions cause string-related bugs and open security vulnerabilities for DOS
attacks.
{{}}
However, beyond ReDoS (Regular expression Denial of Service), little is known
about the extent to which regular expression issues affect software development and how
these issues are addressed in practice.
{{}}
We conduct an empirical study of 356 regex-related
bugs from merged pull requests in Apache, Mozilla, Facebook, and Google GitHub repositories.
{{}}
We identify and classify the nature of the regular expression problems, the fixes, and
the related changes in the test code.
{{}}
The most important findings in this paper are as follows:
{{}}
1) incorrect regular expression semantics is the dominant root cause of regular expression
bugs (165/356, 46.3%).
{{}}
The remaining root causes are incorrect API usage (9.3%) and other
code issues that require regular expression changes in the fix (29.5%), 2) fixing regular
expression bugs is nontrivial as it takes more time and more lines of code to fix them compared to the general pull requests, 3) most (51%) of the regex-related pull requests do not
contain test code changes.
{{}}
Certain regex bug types (e.g., compile error, performance issues,
regex representation) are less likely to include test code changes than others, and 4) the
dominant type of test code changes in regex-related pull requests is test case addition (75%).
{{}}
The results of this study contribute to a broader understanding of the practical problems
faced by developers when using, fixing, and testing regular expressions.
