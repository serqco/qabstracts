Collaboration Challenges in Building ML-Enabled Systems: Communication, Documentation, Engineering, and Process.

The introduction of machine learning (ML) components in software
projects has created the need for software engineers to collabo-
rate with data scientists and other specialists.
{{}}
While collaboration
can always be challenging, ML introduces additional challenges
with its exploratory model development process, additional skills
and knowledge needed, difficulties testing ML systems, need for
continuous evolution and monitoring, and non-traditional quality
requirements such as fairness and explainability.
{{}}
Through inter-
views with 45 practitioners from 28 organizations, we identified
key collaboration challenges that teams face when building and
deploying ML systems into production.
{{}}
We report on common col-
laboration points in the development of production ML systems
for requirements, data, and integration, as well as corresponding
team patterns and challenges.
{{}}
We find that most of these challenges
center around communication, documentation, engineering, and
process, and collect recommendations to address these challenges.

Machine learning (ML) is receiving massive attention and funding
in research and practice; it is achieving incredible advances, surpass-
ing human-level cognition in many applications, but it is widely
acknowledged that moving from a prototyped machine-learned
model to a production system is very challenging.
{{}}
For example,
Venturebeat reported in 2019 that 87 percent of ML projects fail
[108] and Gartner claimed in 2020 that 53 percent do not make
it from prototype to production [70].

While traditional software
projects are already complex, failure prone, and require a broad
range of expertise, the introduction of machine learning raises
