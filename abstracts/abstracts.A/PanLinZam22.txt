Refactoring operations are behavior-preserving changes aimed at improving source code quality.
{{}}
While refactoring is largely considered a good practice, refactoring proposals in pull requests are often rejected after the
code review.
{{}}
Understanding the reasons behind the rejection of refactoring contributions can shed light on
how such contributions can be improved, essentially benefiting software quality.
{{}}
This article reports a study in which we manually coded rejection reasons inferred from 330 refactoringrelated pull requests from 207 open-source Java projects.
{{}}
We surveyed 267 developers to assess their perceived
prevalence of these identified rejection reasons, further complementing the reasons.
{{}}
Our study resulted in a comprehensive taxonomy consisting of 26 refactoring-related rejection reasons and
21 process-related rejection reasons.
{{}}
The taxonomy, accompanied with representative examples and highlighted implications, provides developers with valuable insights on how to ponder and polish their refactoring contributions, and indicates a number of directions researchers can pursue toward better refactoring
recommenders.
