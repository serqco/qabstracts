Sampling in software engineering research: a critical review and guidelines.

Representative sampling appears rare in empirical software engineering research.
{{background}}
Not all
studies need representative samples, but a general lack of representative sampling undermines a scientific field.
{{background}}
This article therefore reports a critical review of the state of sampling
in recent, high-quality software engineering research.
{{objective}}
The key findings are:
{{result}}
(1) random
sampling is rare; (2) sophisticated sampling strategies are very rare; (3) sampling, representativeness and randomness often appear misunderstood.
{{result:i3}}
These findings suggest that
software engineering research has a generalizability crisis.
{{conclusion}}
To address these problems,
this paper synthesizes existing knowledge of sampling into a succinct primer and proposes
extensive guidelines for improving the conduct, presentation and evaluation of sampling
in software engineering research.
{{method}}
It is further recommended that while researchers should
strive for more representative samples, disparaging non-probability sampling is generally
capricious and particularly misguided for predominately qualitative research.

An example of an secondary artifact based on the primary empirical results.
