Linear-time Temporal Logic guided Greybox Fuzzing.

Software model checking as well as runtime verification are veri-
fication techniques which are widely used for checking temporal
properties of software systems.
{{}}
Even though they are property
verification techniques, their common usage in practice is in "bug
finding", that is, finding violations of temporal properties.
{{}}
Moti-
vated by this observation and leveraging the recent progress in
fuzzing, we build a greybox fuzzing framework to find violations
of Linear-time Temporal Logic (LTL) properties.
{{}}
Our framework takes as input a sequential program written in
C/C++, and an LTL property.
{{}}
It finds violations, or counterexample
traces, of the LTL property in stateful software systems; however,
it does not achieve verification.
{{}}
Our work substantially extends
directed greybox fuzzing to witness arbitrarily complex event or-
derings.
{{}}
We note that existing directed greybox fuzzing approaches
are limited to witnessing reaching a location or witnessing simple
event orderings like use-after-free.
{{}}
At the same time, compared
to model checkers, our approach finds the counterexamples faster,
thereby finding more counterexamples within a given time budget.
{{}}
Our LTL-Fuzzer tool, built on top of the AFL fuzzer, is shown
to be effective in detecting bugs in well-known protocol imple-
mentations, such as OpenSSL and Telnet.
{{}}
We use LTL-Fuzzer to
reproduce known vulnerabilities (CVEs), to find 15 zero-day bugs
by checking properties extracted from RFCs (for which 12 CVEs
have been assigned), and to find violations of both safety as well
as liveness properties in real-world protocol implementations.
{{}}
Our
work represents a practical advance over software model checkers
— while simultaneously representing a conceptual advance over
existing greybox fuzzers.
{{}}
Our work thus provides a starting point
for understanding the unexplored synergies among software model
checking, runtime verification and greybox fuzzing.
