Context:
{{}}
Data collected during software engineering experiments might contain quality problems, leading to
wrong experimental conclusions.
{{}}
Objective:
{{}}
We present a data quality (DQ) model and a methodology specific to software engineering experiments,
which provides a systematic approach in order to analyze and improve data quality in this domain.
{{}}
Method:
{{}}
Our proposal considers a multifaceted view of data quality suitable for this context, which enables the
discovery of DQ problems that are not generally addressed.
{{}}
We successfully applied the model (DQMoS) and
methodology (DQMeS) in four controlled experiments, detecting different quality problems that could impact the
experimental results.
{{}}
We present, through a running example, how we applied the DQMoS and DQMeS to one of
the four experimental data.
{{}}
Results:
{{}}
We found that between 55% and 75% of the DQ metrics applied showed the presence of a DQ problem in
all four experiments.
{{}}
In all cases, the experimental results had already been obtained before the DQMeS appli­
cation.
{{}}
This means that the DQ problems we found, were not discovered by the experimenters during or before
making their experiment’s analysis.
{{}}
Results yield data quality problems that experimenters did not detect on
their own analysis, and that affect the experimental response variables.
{{}}
Our proposal shows a formalized
framework that measures and improves the quality of software engineering experimental data.
{{}}
The results of a
survey distributed to the experiments’ responsibles show that they value the improvements introduced by the
model and methodology, and that they intend to apply them again in future experiences.
{{}}
Conclusions:
{{}}
DQMoS and DQMeS are useful to increase the confidence in the quality of data used in software
engineering experiments, and improve the trust in experimental results.
