Context:
{{}}
The usage of User Experience (UX) methods has been studied through the years.
{{}}
However, little is known
about UX professionals’ lifelong learning processes related to UX methods in Agile, choosing what UX methods to
use, and the enablers and hindrances for using the UX methods.
{{}}
Objective:
{{}}
The study aims to broaden current knowledge about UX professionals’ lifelong learning practices to
understand their work situations better.
{{}}
The paper describes how UX professionals learn about and choose UX
methods, their frequency of use, and the enablers and barriers when using the UX methods in Agile.
{{}}
Method:
{{}}
An interview study was conducted with 13 UX professionals from various industries and two countries
working with Agile and UX.
{{}}
We used a qualitative approach, and a thematic analysis was carried out to answer
the research questions.
{{}}
Results:
{{}}
The results show that support from colleagues is an essential component for learning about the methods
and how to use UX methods.
{{}}
Time pressure makes UX professionals choose methods they know will deliver their
desired results.
{{}}
Prototyping, user testing, user journeys, and workshops are the most frequently used UX
methods.
{{}}
Additionally, the results show that UX professionals think that the UX methods are often too compli­
cated and take too long to learn.
{{}}
Additionally, they find it challenging to integrate UX methods into Agile.
{{}}
Conclusion:
{{}}
These findings indicate that UX methods might work better if designed to be less complicated and
deliver results more efficiently.
{{}}
Moreover, collegial and peer learning is central to UX professionals.
{{}}
The HCI
community could be more active in supporting this culture by sharing information and learning.
{{}}
Finally, the
usability and UX of the tools affect which UX methods are used.

Introduction
Researchers and practitioners have introduced many new theories
and UX methods to support UX professionals in their focus on work [16,
18,26,33,41].
{{}}
This has resulted in a continuous learning journey for UX
professionals [51,71].
{{}}
In parallel to this, UX work has increased in
complexity.
{{}}
What started as usability testing involving one user in front
of a computer has developed into a sociotechnical problem space.
{{}}
This
problem space includes numerous software and hardware, presenting
UX professionals with multiple challenges.
{{}}
The problem space is
accompanied by barriers to UX work in Agile software development
processes.
{{}}
Examples of problems are lack of UX awareness, organisa­
tional inconveniences and limiting time constraints [5]12,51,62] even
though there is a stronger focus on UX today than 20 years ago [22].
{{}}
Additionally, a significant issue has been the increasing gap between
research and practice because research lacks knowledge of UX methods
used in practice [34,35].
{{}}
Across industries, professionals focusing on UX use a range of titles
such as UX Designer, UI Developer, and Usability Designer [9].
{{}}
Some
also claim that UX specialists have increasingly worked as business an­
alysts and coaching development teams [22].
{{}}
In their work, they use UX
methods, which are methods (e.g., surveys, interviews, observations) for
improving the user experience (UX) of products or services.
{{}}
Their life­
long learning can be best described as the continuous learning of skills,
acquisition of knowledge, a need for growth, and the application of
knowledge creatively in different environments [36,59].
{{}}
Traditionally,
learning is performed formally, for example, through training and lec­
tures or informally through, for example, self-study [24,37].
{{}}
This paper contributes knowledge about User eXperience Design
(UXD) approaches within Agile processes, abbreviated as Agile UXD.
{{}}
Agile UXD has been studied over the last twenty years [1122,38,46,48].
{{}}
A literature study from 2015 found 83 published papers on usability and
Agile [8].
{{}}
Other literature studies have concluded that within research
on agile, the theme of usability was the second largest in the number of
