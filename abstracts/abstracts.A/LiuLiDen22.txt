Morest: Model-based RESTful API Testing with Execution Feedback.

RESTful APIs are arguably the most popular endpoints for accessing
Web services.
{{background}}
Blackbox testing is one of the emerging techniques
for ensuring the reliability of RESTful APIs.
{{background}}
The major challenge
in testing RESTful APIs is the need for correct sequences of API
operation calls for in-depth testing.
{{background}}
To build meaningful opera-
tion call sequences, researchers have proposed techniques to learn
and utilize the API dependencies based on OpenAPI specifications.
{{background}}
However, these techniques either lack the overall awareness of how
all the APIs are connected or the flexibility of adaptively fixing the
learned knowledge.
{{gap}}
In this paper, we propose Morest, a model-based RESTful API
testing technique that builds and maintains a dynamically updating
RESTful-service Property Graph (RPG) to model the behaviors
of RESTful-services and guide the call sequence generation.
{{objective,design}}
We
empirically evaluated Morest and the results demonstrate that
Morest can successfully request an average of 152.66%-232.45%
more API operations, cover 26.16%-103.24% more lines of code, and
detect 40.64%-215.94% more bugs than state-of-the-art techniques.
{{a-method,result:i1:u1}}
In total, we applied Morest to 6 real-world projects and found
44 bugs (13 of them cannot be detected by existing approaches).
{{method,result}}
Specifically, 2 of the confirmed bugs are from Bitbucket, a famous
code management service with more than 6 million users.
