DeepDiagnosis: Automatically Diagnosing Faults and Recommending Actionable Fixes in Deep Learning Programs.

Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are used in a wide variety of ap-
plications.
{{background}}
However, as in any software application, DNN-based
apps are afflicted with bugs.
{{background}}
Previous work observed that DNN bug
fix patterns are different from traditional bug fix patterns.
{{gap}}
Further-
more, those buggy models are non-trivial to diagnose and fix due
to inexplicit errors with several options to fix them.
{{gap}}
To support
developers in locating and fixing bugs, we propose DeepDiagnosis,
a novel debugging approach that localizes the faults, reports error
symptoms and suggests fixes for DNN programs.
{{objective}}
In the first phase,
our technique monitors a training model, periodically checking for
eight types of error conditions.
{{design}}
Then, in case of problems, it reports
messages containing sufficient information to perform actionable
repairs to the model.
{{design}}
In the evaluation, we thoroughly examine 444
models â€“ 53 real-world from GitHub and Stack Overflow, and 391
curated by AUTOTRAINER.
{{method}}
DeepDiagnosis provides superior accu-
racy when compared to UMLUAT and DeepLocalize.
{{result:i1}}
Our technique
is faster than AUTOTRAINER for fault localization.
{{result:i1}}
The results
show that our approach can support additional types of models,
while state-of-the-art was only able to handle classification ones.
{{result}}
Our technique was able to report bugs that do not manifest as
numerical errors during training.
{{result}}
Also, it can provide actionable in-
sights for fix whereas DeepLocalize can only report faults that lead
to numerical errors during training.
{{result}}
DeepDiagnosis manifests the
best capabilities of fault detection, bug localization, and symptoms
identification when compared to other approaches.
