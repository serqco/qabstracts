Machine translation has wide applications in daily life.
{{cruft}}
In mission-critical applications such as translating
official documents, incorrect translation can have unpleasant or sometimes catastrophic consequences.
{{background}}
This
motivates recent research on the testing methodologies for machine translation systems.
{{background}}
Existing methodologies mostly rely on metamorphic relations designed at the textual level (e.g., Levenshtein distance) or
syntactic level (e.g., distance between grammar structures) to determine the correctness of translation results.
{{background}}
However, these metamorphic relations do not consider whether the original and the translated sentences have the same meaning (i.e., semantic similarity).
{{gap}}
To address this problem, in this article we propose
SemMT, an automatic testing approach for machine translation systems based on semantic similarity checking.
{{objective}}
SemMT applies round-trip translation and measures the semantic similarity between the original and
the translated sentences.
{{design}}
Our insight is that the semantics concerning logical relations and quantifiers in
sentences can be captured by regular expressions (or deterministic finite automata) where efficient semantic
equivalence/similarity checking algorithms can be applied.
{{design}}
Leveraging the insight, we propose three semantic
similarity metrics and implement them in SemMT.
{{design}}
We compared SemMT with related state-of-the-art testing
techniques, demonstrating the effectiveness of mistranslation detection.
{{method}}
The experiment results show that
SemMT outperforms existing metrics, achieving an increase of 34.2% and 15.4% on accuracy and F-score, respectively.
{{result}}
We also study the possibility of further enhancing the performance by combining various metrics.
{{design}}
Finally, we discuss a solution to locate the suspicious trip in round-trip translation, which provides hints for
bug diagnosis.
