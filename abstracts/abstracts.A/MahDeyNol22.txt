One-off events? An empirical study of hackathon code creation and reuse.

Context Hackathons have become popular events for teams to collaborate on projects and
develop software prototypes.
{{}}
Most existing research focuses on activities during an event
with limited attention to the evolution of the hackathon code.
{{}}
Objective We aim to understand the evolution of code used in and created during hackathon
events, with a particular focus on the code blobs, specifically, how frequently hackathon
teams reuse pre-existing code, how much new code they develop, if that code gets reused
afterwards, and what factors affect reuse.
{{}}
Method We collected information about 22,183 hackathon projects from Devpost and
obtained related code blobs, authors, project characteristics, original author, code creation
time, language, and size information from World of Code.
{{}}
We tracked the reuse of code
blobs by identifying all commits containing blobs created during hackathons and identifying all projects that contain those commits.
{{}}
We also conducted a series of surveys in order to
gain a deeper understanding of hackathon code evolution that we sent out to hackathon participants whose code was reused, whose code was not reused, and developers who reused
some hackathon code.
{{}}
Result 9.14% of the code blobs in hackathon repositories and 8% of the lines of code (LOC)
are created during hackathons and around a third of the hackathon code gets reused in
other projects by both blob count and LOC.
{{}}
The number of associated technologies and the
number of participants in hackathons increase reuse probability.
{{}}
Conclusion The results of our study demonstrates hackathons are not always “one-off”
events as the common knowledge dictates and it can serve as a starting point for further
studies in this area.
