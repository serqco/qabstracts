A Universal Data Augmentation Approach for Fault Localization.

Data is the fuel to models, and it is still applicable in fault local-
ization (FL).
{{background}}
Many existing elaborate FL techniques take the code
coverage matrix and failure vector as inputs, expecting the tech-
niques could find the correlation between program entities and
failures.
{{background}}
However, the input data is high-dimensional and extremely
imbalanced since the real-world programs are large in size and the
number of failing test cases is much less than that of passing test
cases, which are posing severe threats to the effectiveness of FL
techniques.
{{background}}
To overcome the limitations, we propose Aeneas, a universal
data augmentation approach that generAtes synthesized failing
test cases from reduced feature space for more precise fault localiza-
tion.
{{objective}}
Specifically, to improve the effectiveness of data augmentation,
Aeneas applies a revised principal component analysis (PCA) first
to generate reduced feature space for more concise representation
of the original coverage matrix, which could also gain efficiency for
data synthesis.
{{design}}
Then, Aeneas handles the imbalanced data issue
through generating synthesized failing test cases from the reduced
feature space through conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE).
{{design}}
To evaluate the effectiveness of Aeneas, we conduct large-scale ex-
periments on 458 versions of 10 programs (from ManyBugs, SIR, and
Defects4J) by six state-of-the-art FL techniques.
{{method}}
The experimental
results clearly show that Aeneas is statistically more effective than
baselines, e.g., our approach can improve the six original methods
by 89% on average under the Top-1 accuracy.
