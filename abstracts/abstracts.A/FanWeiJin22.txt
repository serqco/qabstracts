Explanation-Guided Fairness Testing through Genetic Algorithm.

The fairness characteristic is a critical attribute of trusted AI
systems.
{{background}}
A plethora of research has proposed diverse methods
for individual fairness testing.
{{background}}
However, they are suffering from
three major limitations, i.e., low efficiency, low effectiveness, and
model-specificity.
{{gap}}
This work proposes ExpGA, an explanation-
guided fairness testing approach through a genetic algorithm (GA).
{{objective}}
ExpGA employs the explanation results generated by interpretable
methods to collect high-quality initial seeds, which are prone to
derive discriminatory samples by slightly modifying feature values.
{{design:u1}}
ExpGA then adopts GA to search discriminatory sample candidates
by optimizing a fitness value.
{{design}}
Benefiting from this combination of
explanation results and GA, ExpGA is both efficient and effective to
detect discriminatory individuals.
{{result:i2}}
Moreover, ExpGA only requires
prediction probabilities of the tested model, resulting in a better
generalization capability to various models.
{{design,claim}}
Experiments on
multiple real-world benchmarks, including tabular and text datasets,
show that ExpGA presents higher efficiency and effectiveness than
four state-of-the-art approaches.
