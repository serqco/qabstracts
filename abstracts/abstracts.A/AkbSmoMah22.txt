Context:
{{}}
Development and Operations (DevOps) is a methodology that aims to establish collaboration between
programmers and operators to automate the continuous delivery of new software to reduce the development life
cycle and produce quality software.
{{}}
Development, Security, and Operations (DevSecOps) is developing the
DevOps concept, which integrates security methods into a DevOps process.
{{}}
DevSecOps is a software development
process where security is built in to ensure application confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
{{}}
Objective:
{{}}
This paper aims to identify and prioritize the challenges associated with implementing the DevSecOps
process.
{{}}
Method:
{{}}
We performed a multivocal literature review (MLR) and conducted a questionnaire-based survey to
identify challenges associated with DevSecOps-based projects.
{{}}
Moreover, interpretive structure modeling (ISM)
was applied to study the relationships among the core categories of the challenges.
{{}}
Finally, we used the fuzzy
technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) to prioritize the identified challenges
associated with DevSecOps projects.
{{}}
Results:
{{}}
We identified 18 challenges for the DevSecOps process and mapped them to 10 core categories.
{{}}
The ISM
results indicate that the “standards” category has the most decisive influence on the other nine core categories of
the identified challenges.
{{}}
Moreover, the fuzzy TOPSIS indicates that “lack of secure coding standards,” “lack of
automated testing tools for security in DevOps,” and “ignorance in static testing for security due to lack of
knowledge” are the highest priority challenges for the DevSecOps paradigm.
{{}}
Conclusion:
{{}}
Organizations using DevOps should consider the identified challenges in developing secure software.
