Context:
{{}}
The context-oriented programming paradigm is designed to enable self-adaptation, or dynamic behavior
modification of software systems, in response to changes in their surrounding environment.
{{}}
Contextoriented
programming offers an adaptation model, from a programming language perspective, that maintains a clean
modularisation between the application and adaptation logic, as well as between the components providing
adaptations.
{{}}
Objective:
{{}}
We use three implementation techniques for context-oriented programming languages to assess their
appropriateness to foster self-adaptive systems.
{{}}
These approaches take advantage of the capabilities offered by
the host programming language to realize self-adaptation as proposed by context-oriented languages.
{{}}
Method:
{{}}
We evaluate each of these approaches by assessing their modularity and complexity when defining
adaptations, and by comparing their run-time performance on a simple benchmark.
{{}}
Results:
{{}}
Our results show a higher modularity than that for common architecture based self-adaptive systems,
while maintaining comparable performance.
{{}}
Conclusion:
{{}}
We conclude that context-oriented programming is an appropriate paradigm to realize selfadaptation.
