The effects of continuous integration on software development: a systematic literature review.

Context Continuous integration (CI) is a software engineering technique that proclaims frequent activities to assure the software product health.
{{h-background,background}}
Researchers and practitioners mention
several benefits related to CI.
{{background}}
However, no systematic study surveys state of the art regarding
such benefits or cons.
{{gap}}
Objective This study aims to identify and interpret empirical evidence regarding how CI
impacts software development.
{{h-objective,objective}}
Method Through a Systematic Literature Review, we search for studies in six digital
libraries.
{{h-method,method}}
Starting from 479 studies, we select 101 empirical studies that evaluate CI in the
context of software development.
{{method}}
We thoroughly read and extract information regarding (i)
the CI environment, (ii) findings related to the effects of CI, and (iii) the employed research
methods.
{{method}}
We apply a thematic synthesis to group and summarize the findings.
{{method}}
Results Existing research has explored the positive effects of CI, such as better cooperation,
or negative effects, such as adding technical and process challenges.
{{h-result,result}}
From our thematic synthesis, we identify six themes:
{{result}}
development activities, software process, quality assurance,
integration patterns, issues & defects, and build patterns.
{{result}}
Conclusions Empirical research in CI has been increasing over recent years.
{{h-conclusion,result}}
We found that
much of the existing research reveals that CI brings positive effects to software development.
{{result}}
However, CI may also bring technical challenges to software development teams.
{{result}}
Despite
the overall positive outlook regarding CI, we still find room for improvements in the existing
empirical research that evaluates the effects of CI.
