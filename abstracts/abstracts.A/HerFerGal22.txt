Uniform and scalable sampling of highly configurable systems.

Many analyses on configurable software systems are intractable when confronted with
colossal and highly-constrained configuration spaces.
{{background}}
These analyses could instead use
statistical inference, where a tractable sample accurately predicts results for the entire
space.
{{background}}
To do so, the laws of statistical inference requires each member of the population
to be equally likely to be included in the sample, i.e., the sampling process needs to be
“uniform”.
{{background}}
SAT-samplers have been developed to generate uniform random samples at a
reasonable computational cost.
{{background}}
However, there is a lack of experimental validation over
colossal spaces to show whether the samplers indeed produce uniform samples or not.
{{background}}
This
paper (i) proposes a new sampler named BDDSampler, (ii) presents a new statistical test
to verify sampler uniformity, and (iii) reports the evaluation of BDDSampler and five
other state-of-the-art samplers: KUS, QuickSampler, Smarch, Spur, and Unigen2.
{{objective,a-design}}
Our
experimental results show only BDDSampler satisfies both scalability and uniformity.
