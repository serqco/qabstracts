Automated Expansion of Abbreviations Based on Semantic Relation and Transfer Expansion.

Although the negative impact of abbreviations in source code is well-recognized, abbreviations are common for various
reasons.
{{background}}
To this end, a number of approaches have been proposed to expand abbreviations in identifiers.
{{background}}
However, such approaches
are either inaccurate or confined to specific identifiers.
{{gap}}
To this end, in this paper, we propose a generic and accurate approach to
expand identifier abbreviations by leveraging both semantic relation and transfer expansion.
{{objective}}
One of the key insights of the approach is
that abbreviations in the name of software entity e have a great chance to find their full terms in names of software entities that are
semantically related to e.
{{design,-ignorediff}}
Consequently, the proposed approach builds a knowledge graph to represent such entities and their
relationships with e and searches the graph for full terms.
{{design}}
Another key insight is that literally identical abbreviations within the same
application are likely (but not necessary) to have identical expansions, and thus the semantics-based expansion in one place may be
transferred to other places.
{{design,-ignorediff}}
To investigate when abbreviation expansion could be transferred safely, we conduct a case study on three
open-source applications.
{{method}}
The results suggest that a significant part (75 percent) of expansions could be transferred among lexically
identical abbreviations within the same application.
{{result}}
However, the risk of transfer varies according to various factors, e.g., length of
abbreviations, the physical distance between abbreviations, and semantic relations between abbreviations.
{{result}}
Based on these findings,
we design nine heuristics for transfer expansion and propose a learning-based approach to prioritize both transfer heuristics and
semantic-based expansion heuristics.
{{design}}
Evaluation results on nine open-source applications suggest that the proposed approach
significantly improves the state of the art, improving recall from 29 to 89 percent and precision from 39 to 92 percent.

Typical example of a common problem in abstract interpretation:
"To this end, in this paper, we propose a generic and accurate approach to
expand identifier abbreviations by leveraging both semantic relation and transfer expansion."
Is the "by leveraging" part still objective or already design?
Only the authors can decide, but since they put both parts in a single sentence, 
we read it all as the objective. 
BTW: Very nice work!
