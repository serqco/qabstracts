On Debugging the Performance of Configurable Software Systems: Developer Needs and Tailored Tool Support.

Determining whether a configurable software system has a per-
formance bug or it was misconfigured is often challenging.
{{}}
While
there are numerous debugging techniques that can support devel-
opers in this task, there is limited empirical evidence of how useful
the techniques are to address the actual needs that developers have
when debugging the performance of configurable software systems;
most techniques are often evaluated in terms of technical accuracy
instead of their usability.
{{}}
In this paper, we take a human-centered
approach to identify, design, implement, and evaluate a solution to
support developers in the process of debugging the performance
of configurable software systems.
{{}}
We first conduct an exploratory
study with 19 developers to identify the information needs that
developers have during this process.
{{}}
Subsequently, we design and
implement a tailored tool, adapting techniques from prior work, to
support those needs.
{{}}
Two user studies, with a total of 20 developers,
validate and confirm that the information that we provide helps de-
velopers debug the performance of configurable software systems.

Developers often spend a substantial amount of time diagnosing a
configurable software system to localize and fix a performance bug,
or to determine that the system was misconfigured [8, 11, 26, 30,
32, 33, 55, 58, 59, 86].
{{}}
This struggle is quite common when main-
taining configurable software systems.
{{}}
Some empirical studies find
that 59 percent of performance issues are related to configuration
errors, 88 percent of these issues require fixing the code [26, 27],
of which 61 percent take an average of 5 weeks to fix [41], and that
50 percent of patches in open-source cloud systems and 30 percent
