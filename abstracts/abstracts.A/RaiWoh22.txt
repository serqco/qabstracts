Recruiting credible participants for field studies in software engineering research.

Context:
{{h-background}}
Software practitioners are a primary provider of information for field studies in software engineering.
{{background}}
Research typically recruits practitioners through some kind of sampling.
{{background}}
But sampling may not in itself recruit
the "right" participants.
{{gap}}
Objective:
{{h-objective}}
To assess existing guidance on participant recruitment, and to propose and illustrate a framework
for recruiting professional practitioners as credible participants in field studies of software engineering.
{{objective}}
Methods:
{{h-method}}
We review existing guidelines, checklists and other advisory sources on recruiting participants for
field studies.
{{method:i1}}
We develop a framework, partly based on our prior research and on the research of others.
{{design}}
We
search for and select three exemplar studies (a case study, an interview study and a survey study) and use
those to illustrate the framework.
{{method}}
Results:
{{h-result}}
Whilst existing guidance recognises the importance of recruiting participants, there is limited guidance
on how to recruit the "right" participants.
{{result}}
The framework suggests the conceptualisation of participants as
"research instruments" or, alternatively, as a sampling frame for items of interest.
{{result}}
The exemplars suggest
that at least some members of the research community are aware of the need to carefully recruit the "right"
participants.
{{result}}
Conclusions:
{{h-conclusion}}
The framework is intended to encourage researchers to think differently about the involvement of
practitioners in field studies of software engineering.
{{fposs}}
Also, the framework identifies a number of characteristics
not explicitly addressed by existing guidelines.
