Exploiting Input Sanitization for Regex Denial of Service.

Web services use server-side input sanitization to guard against
harmful input.
{{background}}
Some web services publish their sanitization logic
to make their client interface more usable, e.g., allowing clients to
debug invalid requests locally.
{{background}}
However, this usability practice poses
a security risk.
{{background}}
Specifically, services may share the regexes they use
to sanitize input strings â€” and regex-based denial of service (ReDoS)
is an emerging threat.
{{background}}
Although prominent service outages caused
by ReDoS have spurred interest in this topic, we know little about
the degree to which live web services are vulnerable to ReDoS.
{{gap}}
In this paper, we conduct the first black-box study measuring
the extent of ReDoS vulnerabilities in live web services.
{{objective}}
We apply
the Consistent Sanitization Assumption:
{{method}}
that client-side sanitization
logic, including regexes, is consistent with the sanitization logic on
the server-side.
{{method}}
We identify a service's regex-based input sanitiza-
tion in its HTML forms or its API, find vulnerable regexes among
these regexes, craft ReDoS probes, and pinpoint vulnerabilities.
{{method}}
We
analyzed the HTML forms of 1,000 services and the APIs of 475
services.
{{method}}
Of these, 355 services publish regexes; 17 services publish
unsafe regexes; and 6 services are vulnerable to ReDoS through
their APIs (6 domains; 15 subdomains).
{{result}}
Both Microsoft and Ama-
zon Web Services patched their web services as a result of our
disclosure.
{{result}}
Since these vulnerabilities were from API specifications,
not HTML forms, we proposed a ReDoS defense for a popular API
validation library, and our patch has been merged.
{{design}}
To summarize:
{{summary}}
in client-visible sanitization logic, some web services advertise Re-
DoS vulnerabilities in plain sight.
{{summary}}
Our results motivate short-term
patches and long-term fundamental solutions.

I am not sure if sentence 12 counts as a result, as it was not intended in the scope of this research. It sounds more like an anecdote.
Also, I don't think we have a code for the final sentence, which is a quote.
