Context:
{{}}
Software Architecture (SA) and Source Code (SC) are two intertwined artefacts that represent the
interdependent design decisions made at different levels of abstractions - High-Level (HL) and Low-Level (LL).
{{}}
An
understanding of the relationships between SA and SC is expected to bridge the gap between SA and SC for
supporting maintenance and evolution of software systems.
{{}}
Objective:
{{}}
We aimed at exploring practitioners’ understanding about the relationships between SA and SC.
{{}}
Method:
{{}}
We used a mixed-method that combines an online survey with 87 respondents and an interview with 8
participants to collect the views of practitioners from 37 countries about the relationships between SA and SC.
{{}}
Results:
{{}}
Our results reveal that:
{{}}
practitioners mainly discuss five features of relationships between SA and SC; a
few practitioners have adopted dedicated approaches and tools in the literature for identifying and analyzing the
relationships between SA and SC despite recognizing the importance of such information for improving a sys­
tem’s quality attributes, especially maintainability and reliability.
{{}}
It is felt that cost and effort are the major
impediments that prevent practitioners from identifying, analyzing, and using the relationships between SA and
SC.
{{}}
Conclusions:
{{}}
The results have empirically identified five features of relationships between SA and SC reported in
the literature from the perspective of practitioners and a systematic framework to manage the five features of
relationships should be developed with dedicated approaches and tools considering the cost and benefit of
maintaining the relationships.
