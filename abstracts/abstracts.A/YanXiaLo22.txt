Predictive Models in Software Engineering: Challenges and Opportunities.


Predictive models are one of the most important techniques that are widely applied in many areas of software
engineering.
{{background}}
There have been a large number of primary studies that apply predictive models and that present
well-performed studies in various research domains, including software requirements, software design and
development, testing and debugging, and software maintenance.

This article is a first attempt to systematically
organize knowledge in this area by surveying a body of 421 papers on predictive models published between
2009 and 2020.
{{objective,method}}
We describe the key models and approaches used, classify the different models, summarize the
range of key application areas, and analyze research results.
{{method}}
Based on our findings, we also propose a set of
current challenges that still need to be addressed in future work and provide a proposed research road map
for these opportunities.
