Feature toggles as code: Heuristics and metrics for structuring feature toggles.

Context:
{{}}
Using feature toggles is a technique to turn a feature either on or off in program code by checking the
value of a variable in a conditional statement.
{{}}
This technique is increasingly used by software practitioners to
support continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD).
{{}}
However, using feature toggles may increase
code complexity, create dead code, and decrease the quality of a codebase.
{{}}
Objective:
{{}}
The goal of this research is to aid software practitioners in structuring feature toggles in the
codebase by proposing and evaluating a set of heuristics and corresponding complexity, comprehensibility,
and maintainability metrics based upon an empirical study of open source repositories.
{{}}
Method:
{{}}
We identified 80 GitHub repositories that use feature toggles in their development cycle.
{{}}
We
conducted a qualitative analysis using 60 of the 80 repositories to identify heuristics and metrics.
{{}}
Then, we
conducted a survey of practitioners of 80 repositories to obtain their feedback that the proposed heuristics can
be used to guide the structure of feature toggles and to reduce technical debt.
{{}}
We also conducted a case study
of the all 80 repositories to analyze relations between heuristics and metrics.
{{}}
Results:
{{}}
From the qualitative analysis, we proposed 7 heuristics to guide structuring feature toggles and
identified 12 metrics to support the principles embodied in the heuristics.
{{}}
Our survey result shows that
practitioners agree that managing feature toggles is difficult, and using identified heuristics can reduce
technical debt.
{{}}
Based on our case study, we find a relationship between the adoption of heuristics and the
values of metrics.
{{}}
Conclusions:
{{}}
Our results support that practitioners should have self-descriptive feature toggles, use feature
toggles sparingly, avoid duplicate code in using feature toggles, and ensure complete removal of a feature
toggle.
