Context:
{{}}
Developing high-quality software requires skilled software professionals equipped with a set of basic and
essential software engineering competencies (SEC).
{{}}
These competencies and the satisfaction levels derived from
them change over a project’s lifecycle, or as software professionals move from one project to another.
{{}}
Objective:
{{}}
Previous studies suggest a lack of means enabling SEC stakeholders to identify and assess competencies
suitable for different projects.
{{}}
Additionally, previous research has mainly portrayed SEC to be static and over­
looked their evolution over time and across projects.
{{}}
We investigate how we could effectively identify and match
the competencies of software professionals necessary for different projects.
{{}}
Method:
{{}}
We follow a mixed-method approach to iteratively develop and evaluate a framework for identifying and
managing SEC.
{{}}
In so doing, we use the results of an extensive literature review, focus group discussions with
experts from academia and industry, and data collected through interviews with 138 individuals with a super­
visory role in the software industry.
{{}}
Results:
{{}}
Drawing on the Kano model and Competency Framework for Software Engineers, we propose a Unified
Competence Gate for Software Professionals (UComGSP), a framework for identifying and managing SEC.
{{}}
The
UComGSP consists of 62 hard competencies, 63 soft competencies, and 25 essential SEC competencies.
{{}}
Addi­
tionally, we propose three stakeholders’ satisfaction levels for SEC assessment:
{{}}
basic, performance, and delighter.
{{}}
Furthermore, based on empirical observation, we report 27 competencies not mentioned in the reviewed liter­
ature; 11 of them are considered essential competencies.
{{}}
Conclusion:
{{}}
Competence development involves different stakeholders, including software professionals, educa­
tors, and the software industry.
{{}}
The UComGSP framework enables SEC stakeholders to (i) identify SE compe­
tencies, (ii) identify the essential SEC, and (iii) assess the satisfaction levels that can be derived from different
competencies.
{{}}
Future research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework across software
development projects.
