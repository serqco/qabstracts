Practitioners&apos; Expectations on Automated Code Comment Generation.

Good comments are invaluable assets to software projects, as they
help developers understand and maintain projects.
{{}}
However, due
to some poor commenting practices, comments are often missing
or inconsistent with the source code.
{{}}
Software engineering practi-
tioners often spend a significant amount of time and effort reading
and understanding programs without or with poor comments.
{{}}
To
counter this, researchers have proposed various techniques to au-
tomatically generate code comments in recent years, which can
not only save developers time writing comments but also help
them better understand existing software projects.
{{}}
However, it is
unclear whether these techniques can alleviate comment issues
and whether practitioners appreciate this line of research.
{{}}
To fill
this gap, we performed an empirical study by interviewing and
surveying practitioners about their expectations of research in code
comment generation.
{{}}
We then compared what practitioners need
and the current state-of-the-art research by performing a literature
review of papers on code comment generation techniques pub-
lished in the premier publication venues from 2010 to 2020.
{{}}
From
this comparison, we highlighted the directions where researchers
need to put effort to develop comment generation techniques that
matter to practitioners.
