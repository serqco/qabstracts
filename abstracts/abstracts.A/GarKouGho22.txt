Forecasting Architectural Decay From Evolutionary History.

As a software system evolves, its architecture tends to decay, leading to the occurrence of architectural elements that
become resistant to maintenance or prone to defects.
{{background}}
To address this problem, engineers can significantly benefit from determining
which architectural elements will decay before that decay actually occurs.
{{background}}
Forecasting decay allows engineers to take steps to prevent
decay, such as focusing maintenance resources on the architectural elements most likely to decay.
{{background}}
To that end, we construct novel
models that predict the quality of an architectural element by utilizing multiple architectural views (both structural and semantic) and
architectural metrics as features for prediction.
{{objective,design}}
We conduct an empirical study using our prediction models on 38 versions of five
systems.
{{method}}
Our findings show that we can predict low architectural quality, i.e., architectural decay, with high performanceâ€”even for
cases of decay that suddenly occur in an architectural module.
{{result:i1}}
We further report the factors that best predict architectural quality.
