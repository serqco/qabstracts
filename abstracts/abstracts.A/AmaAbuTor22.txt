AI-Enabled Automation for Completeness Checking of Privacy Policies.

Technological advances in information sharing have raised concerns about data protection.
{{background}}
Privacy policies contain
privacy-related requirements about how the personal data of individuals will be handled by an organization or a software system
(e.g., a web service or an app).
{{background}}
In Europe, privacy policies are subject to compliance with the General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR).
{{background}}
A prerequisite for GDPR compliance checking is to verify whether the content of a privacy policy is
complete according to the provisions of GDPR.
{{background}}
Incomplete privacy policies might result in large fines on violating organization
as well as incomplete privacy-related software specifications.
{{background}}
Manual completeness checking is both time-consuming and errorprone.
{{gap}}
In this paper, we propose AI-based automation for the completeness checking of privacy policies.
{{objective}}
Through systematic
qualitative methods, we first build two artifacts to characterize the privacy-related provisions of GDPR, namely a conceptual
model and a set of completeness criteria.
{{design}}
Then, we develop an automated solution on top of these artifacts by leveraging a
combination of natural language processing and supervised machine learning.
{{design}}
Specifically, we identify the GDPR-relevant
information content in privacy policies and subsequently check them against the completeness criteria.
{{design}}
To evaluate our
approach, we collected 234 real privacy policies from the fund industry.
{{method}}
Over a set of 48 unseen privacy policies, our approach
detected 300 of the total of 334 violations of some completeness criteria correctly, while producing 23 false positives.
{{result}}
The
approach thus has a precision of 92.9% and recall of 89.8%.
{{result}}
Compared to a baseline that applies keyword search only, our
approach results in an improvement of 24.5% in precision and 38% in recall.
