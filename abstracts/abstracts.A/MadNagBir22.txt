ConE: A Concurrent Edit Detection Tool for Large-scale Software Development.


Modern, complex software systems are being continuously extended and adjusted.
{{background}}
The developers responsible
for this may come from different teams or organizations, and may be distributed over the world.
{{background}}
This may
make it difficult to keep track of what other developers are doing, which may result in multiple developers
concurrently editing the same code areas.
{{background}}
This, in turn, may lead to hard-to-merge changes or even merge
conflicts, logical bugs that are difficult to detect, duplication of work, and wasted developer productivity.
{{background}}
To
address this, we explore the extent of this problem in the pull-request-based software development model.
{{objective}}
We
study half a year of changes made to six large repositories in Microsoft in which at least 1,000 pull requests
are created each month.
{{method}}
We find that files concurrently edited in different pull requests are more likely to
introduce bugs.
{{result:i1}}
Motivated by these findings, we design, implement, and deploy a service named Concurrent
Edit Detector (ConE) that proactively detects pull requests containing concurrent edits, to help mitigate the
problems caused by them.
{{method}}
ConE has been designed to scale, and to minimize false alarms while still flagging
relevant concurrently edited files.
{{method}}
Key concepts of ConE include the detection of the Extent of Overlap between
pull requests, and the identification of Rarely Concurrently Edited Files.
{{method}}
To evaluate ConE, we report on its
operational deployment on 234 repositories inside Microsoft.
{{method}}
ConE assessed 26,000 pull requests and made
775 recommendations about conflicting changes, which were rated as useful in over 70% (554) of the cases.
{{result}}
From interviews with 48 users, we learned that they believed ConE would save time in conflict resolution
and avoiding duplicate work, and that over 90% intend to keep using the service on a daily basis.

I think this is a design paper, but the objective frames it as an empirical paper. Coded as an empirical paper.
