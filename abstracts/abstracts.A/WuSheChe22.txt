Automatically repairing tensor shape faults in deep learning programs.

Context:
{{}}
Software developers frequently invoke deep learning (DL) APIs to incorporate artificial intelligence
solutions into software systems.
{{}}
However, misuses of these APIs can cause various DL faults, such as tensor
shape faults.
{{}}
Tensor shape faults occur when restriction conditions of operations are not met; they are prevalent
in practice, leading to many system crashes.
{{}}
Meanwhile, researchers and engineers still face a strong challenge
in detecting tensor shape faults — static techniques incur heavy overheads in defining detection rules, and the
only dynamic technique requires human engineers to rewrite APIs for tracking shape changes.
{{}}
Objective:
{{}}
This paper introduces a novel technique that leverages machine learning to detect tensor shape
faults, and as well uses patterns to repair faults detected.
{{}}
Methods:
{{}}
We first construct SFData, a set of 146 buggy programs with crashing tensor shape faults (i.e.,
those causing programs to crash).
{{}}
We also conduct an empirical study on crashing tensor shape faults,
categorizing them into four types and revealing twelve repair patterns.
{{}}
Then we propose Tensfa2, an automated
approach to detecting and repairing crashing tensor shape faults.
{{}}
Tensfa2 employs a machine learning method
to learn from crash messages and decision trees to detect tensor shape faults.
{{}}
Next, Tensfa2 tracks shape
properties by a customized Python debugger, analyzes their data dependences, and uses the twelve patterns
to generate patches.
{{}}
Tensfa2 is an extended version of Tensfa—our previous approach presented at ISSRE’21.
{{}}
Its performance is enhanced by two techniques:
{{}}
a search-based method for repairing shape value faults, and
a bundle of three ranking strategies for prioritizing the repair patterns.
{{}}
Results:
{{}}
Tensfa2 is evaluated on SFData and IslamData (another dataset of tensor shape faults).
{{}}
The results
show the effectiveness of Tensfa2.
{{}}
In particular, Tensfa2 achieves an F1-score of 96.88% in detecting the faults
and repairs 82 out of 146 buggy programs in SFData.
{{}}
Conclusion:
{{}}
We believe that repair patches generated by our approach will help engineers fix their deep
learning programs much more efficiently, saving their time and efforts.
