Conflict-aware Inference of Python Compatible Runtime Environments with Domain Knowledge Graph.

Code sharing and reuse is a widespread use practice in software
engineering.
{{}}
Although a vast amount of open-source Python code
is accessible on many online platforms, programmers often find
it difficult to restore a successful runtime environment.
{{}}
Previous
studies validated automatic inference of Python dependencies using
pre-built knowledge bases.
{{}}
However, these studies do not cover
sufficient knowledge to accurately match the Python code and also
ignore the potential conflicts between their inferred dependencies,
thus resulting in a low success rate of inference.
{{}}
In this paper, we
propose PyCRE, a new approach to automatically inferring Python
compatible runtime environments with domain knowledge graph
(KG).
{{}}
Specifically, we design a domain-specific ontology for Python
third-party packages and construct KGs for over 10,000 popular
packages in Python 2 and Python 3.
{{}}
PyCRE discovers candidate
libraries by measuring the matching degree between the known
libraries and the third-party resources used in target code.
{{}}
For the
NP-complete problem of dependency solving, we propose a heuris-
tic graph traversal algorithm to efficiently guarantee the compat-
ibility between packages.
{{}}
PyCRE achieves superior performance
on a real-world dataset and efficiently resolves nearly half more
import errors than previous methods.
