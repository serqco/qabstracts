Experimental Evaluation of Test-Driven Development With Interns Working on a Real Industrial Project.

Context:
{{h-background}}
There is still little evidence on differences between Test-Driven Development and Test-Last Development,
especially for real-world projects, so their impact on code/test quality is an ongoing research trend.
{{background}}
An empirical comparison is
presented, with 19 participants working on an industrial project developed for an energy market software company, implementing realworld requirements for one of the companyâ€™s customers.
{{method}}
Objective:
{{h-objective}}
Examine the impact of TDD and TLD on quality of the code and the
tests.
{{objective}}
The aim is to evaluate if there is a significant difference in external code quality and test quality between these techniques.
{{objective}}
Method:
{{h-method}}
The experiment is based on a randomized within-subjects block design, with participants working for three months on the
same requirements using different techniques, changed from week to week, within three different competence blocks:
{{method}}
Intermediate,
Novice and Mixed.
{{method}}
The resulting code was verified for process conformance.
{{method}}
The participants developed only business logic and were
separated from infrastructural concerns.
{{method}}
A separate group of code repositories was used to work without unit tests, to verify that the
requirements were not too easy for the participants.
{{method}}
Also, it was analysed if there is any difference between the code created by shared
efforts of developers with different competences and the code created by participants isolated in the competence blocks.
{{method}}
The resulting
implementations had LOC order of magnitude of 10k.
{{result}}
Results:
{{h-result}}
Statistically significant advantage of TDD in terms of external code
quality (1.8 fewer bugs) and test quality (5 percentage points higher) than TLD.
{{result:u1}}
Additionally, TDD narrows the gap in code coverage
between developers from different competence blocks.
{{result:i2}}
At the same time, TDD proved to have a considerable entry barrier and was
hard to follow strictly, especially by Novices.
{{result:i1}}
Still, no significant difference w.r.t.
code coverage has been observed between the
Intermediate and the Novice developers - as opposed to TLD, which was easier to follow.
{{result:i1}}
Lastly, isolating the Intermediate developers
from the Novices had significant impact on the code quality.
{{result:i1}}
Conclusion:TDD is a recommended technique for software projects with a
long horizon or when it is critical to minimize the number of bugs and achieve high code coverage.
