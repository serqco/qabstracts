Free Lunch for Testing: Fuzzing Deep-Learning Libraries from Open Source.

Deep learning (DL) systems can make our life much easier, and
thus are gaining more and more attention from both academia and
industry.
{{}}
Meanwhile, bugs in DL systems can be disastrous, and
can even threaten human lives in safety-critical applications.
{{}}
To
date, a huge body of research efforts have been dedicated to test-
ing DL models.
{{}}
However, interestingly, there is still limited work
for testing the underlying DL libraries, which are the foundation
for building, optimizing, and running DL models.
{{}}
One potential
reason is that test generation for the underlying DL libraries can
be rather challenging since their public APIs are mainly exposed
in Python, making it even hard to automatically determine the
API input parameter types due to dynamic typing.
{{}}
In this paper,
we propose FreeFuzz, the first approach to fuzzing DL libraries
via mining from open source.
{{}}
More specifically, FreeFuzz obtains
code/models from three different sources:
{{}}
1) code snippets from the
library documentation, 2) library developer tests, and 3) DL models
in the wild.
{{}}
Then, FreeFuzz automatically runs all the collected
code/models with instrumentation to trace the dynamic informa-
tion for each covered API, including the types and values of each
parameter during invocation, and shapes of input/output tensors.
{{}}
Lastly, FreeFuzz will leverage the traced dynamic information to
perform fuzz testing for each covered API.
{{}}
The extensive study of
FreeFuzz on PyTorch and TensorFlow, two of the most popular DL
libraries, shows that FreeFuzz is able to automatically trace valid
dynamic information for fuzzing 1158 popular APIs, 9X more than
state-of-the-art LEMON with 3.5X lower overhead than LEMON.
{{}}
To date, FreeFuzz has detected 49 bugs for PyTorch and TensorFlow
(with 38 already confirmed by developers as previously unknown).
