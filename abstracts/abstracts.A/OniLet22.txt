Release planning—deciding what features to implement in upcoming releases of a software system—is a critical activity in iterative software development.
{{}}
Many release planning methods exist, but most ignore the
inevitable uncertainty in estimating software development effort and business value.
{{}}
The article’s objective
is to study whether analyzing uncertainty during release planning generates better release plans than if
uncertainty is ignored.
{{}}
To study this question, we have developed a novel release planning method under uncertainty, called BEARS, that models uncertainty using Bayesian probability distributions and recommends
release plans that maximize expected net present value and expected punctuality.
{{}}
We then compare release
plans recommended by BEARS to those recommended by methods that ignore uncertainty on 32 release
planning problems.
{{}}
The experiment shows that BEARS recommends release plans with higher expected net
present value and expected punctuality than methods that ignore uncertainty, thereby indicating the harmful
effects of ignoring uncertainty during release planning.
{{}}
These results highlight the importance of eliciting
and analyzing uncertainty in software effort and value estimations and call for increased research in these
areas.
