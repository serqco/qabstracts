Bug Localization in Model-Based Systems in the Wild.


The companies that have adopted the Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) paradigm have the advantage of
working at a high level of abstraction.
{{background}}
Nevertheless, they have the disadvantage of the lack of tools available
to perform bug localization at the model level.
{{background}}
In addition, in an MDE context, a bug can be related to different
MDE artefacts, such as design-time models, model transformations, or run-time models.
{{background}}
Starting the bug
localization in the wrong place or with the wrong tool can lead to a result that is unsatisfactory.
{{gap}}
We evaluate
how to apply the existing model-based approaches in order to mitigate the effect of starting the localization
in the wrong place.
{{objective}}
We also take into account that software engineers can refine the results at different stages.
{{objective}}
In our evaluation, we compare different combinations of the application of bug localization approaches and
human refinement.
{{method}}
The combination of our approaches plus manual refinement obtains the best results.
{{result:i1}}
We
performed a statistical analysis to provide evidence of the significance of the results.
{{a-result}}
The conclusions obtained
from this evaluation are:
{{conclusion}}
humans have to be involved at the right time in the process (or results can even get
worse), and artefact-independence can be achieved without worsening the results.
