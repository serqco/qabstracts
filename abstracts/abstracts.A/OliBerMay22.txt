A Delphi study to recognize and assess systems of systems vulnerabilities.

Context:
{{}}
System of Systems (SoS) is an emerging paradigm by which independent systems collaborate by sharing
resources and processes to achieve objectives that they could not achieve on their own.
{{}}
In this context, a number
of emergent behaviors may arise that can undermine the security of the constituent systems.
{{}}
Objective:
{{}}
We apply the Delphi method with the aims to improve our understanding of SoS security and related
problems, and to investigate their possible causes and remedies.
{{}}
Method:
{{}}
Experts on SoS expressed their opinions and reached consensus in a series of rounds by following a
structured questionnaire.
{{}}
Results:
{{}}
The results show that the experts found more consensus in disagreement than in agreement about some
SoS characteristics, and on how SoS vulnerabilities could be identified and prevented.
{{}}
Conclusions:
{{}}
From this study we learn that more work is needed to reach a shared understanding of SoS vulÂ­
nerabilities, and we leverage expert feedback to outline some future research directions.
