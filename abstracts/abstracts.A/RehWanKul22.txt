Newcomer OSS-Candidates: Characterizing Contributions of Novice Developers to GitHub.

The ability of an Open Source Software (OSS) project to attract, onboard, and retain any
newcomer is vital to its livelihood.
{{background}}
Although, evidence suggests an upsurge in novice
developers joining social coding platforms (such as GitHub), the extent to which their activities result in a OSS contribution is unknown.
{{gap}}
Henceforth, we execute the protocols of
a registered report to study activities of a “Newcomer OSS-Candidate”, who is a novice
developer that is new to that social coding platform, and has the intention to later onboard
an OSS project.
{{objective}}
Using GitHub as a case platform, we analyze 171 identified Newcomer
OSS-Candidates to characterize their contribution activities.
{{method}}
Results show that Newcomer
OSS-Candidates are likely to target software based repositories (i.e., 66%), and their first
contributions are mainly associated with development (commits) and maintenance (PRs).
{{result:i1}}
Newcomer OSS-Candidates are less likely to practice social coding, but eventually end up
onboarding (i.e., 30% quantitative, 70% follow-up survey) an OSS project.
{{result:i1:u2}}
Furthermore,
they cite finding a way to start as the most challenging barrier to contribute.
{{result}}
Our work
reveals insights on how newcomers to social coding platforms are potential sources of OSS
contributions.
