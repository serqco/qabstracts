Automated feedback generation for introductory programming assignments is useful for programming education.
{{}}
Most works try to generate feedback to correct a student program by comparing its behavior with an
instructorâ€™s reference program on selected tests.
{{}}
In this work, our aim is to generate verifiably correct program repairs as student feedback.
{{}}
A student-submitted program is aligned and composed with a reference
solution in terms of control flow, and the variables of the two programs are automatically aligned via predicates describing the relationship between the variables.
{{}}
When verification attempt for the obtained aligned
program fails, we turn a verification problem into a MaxSMT problem whose solution leads to a minimal
repair.
{{}}
We have conducted experiments on student assignments curated from a widely deployed intelligent
tutoring system.
{{}}
Our results show that generating verified repair without sacrificing the overall repair rate is
possible.
{{}}
In fact, our implementation, Verifix, is shown to outperform Clara, a state-of-the-art tool, in terms
of repair rate.
{{}}
This shows the promise of using verified repair to generate high confidence feedback in programming pedagogy settings.
