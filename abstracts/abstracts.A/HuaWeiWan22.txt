Yet another combination of IR- and neural-based comment generation.

Background:
{{h-background}}
Code comment generation techniques aim to generate natural language descriptions for source
code.
{{background}}
There are two orthogonal approaches for this task, i.e., information retrieval (IR) based and neuralbased methods.
{{background}}
Recent studies have focused on combining their strengths by feeding the input code and its
similar code snippets retrieved by the IR-based approach to the neural-based approach, which can enhance
the neural-based approach’s ability to output low-frequency words and further improve the performance.
{{background}}
Aim:
{{h-objective}}
However, despite the tremendous progress, our pilot study reveals that the current combination is not
generalizable and can lead to performance degradation.
{{result}}
In this paper, we propose a straightforward but
effective approach to tackle the issue of existing combinations of these two comment generation approaches.
{{objective}}
Method:
{{h-method}}
Instead of binding IR- and neural-based approaches statically, we combine them in a dynamic manner.
{{design}}
Specifically, given an input code snippet, we first use an IR-based technique to retrieve a similar code snippet
from the corpus.
{{design}}
Then we use a Cross-Encoder based classifier to decide the comment generation method to
be used dynamically, i.e., if the retrieved similar code snippet is a true positive (i.e., is semantically similar
to the input), we directly use the IR-based technique.
{{design}}
Otherwise, we pass the input to the neural-based model
to generate the comment.
{{design}}
Results:
{{h-result}}
We evaluate our approach on a large-scale dataset of Java projects.
{{method}}
Experiment results show that our
approach can achieve 25.45 BLEU score, which improves the state-of-the-art IR-based approach, neural-based
approach, and their combination by 41%, 26%, and 7%, respectively.
{{result}}
Conclusions:
{{h-conclusion}}
We propose a straightforward but effective dynamic combination of IR-based and neural-based
comment generation, which outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by a substantial margin.
