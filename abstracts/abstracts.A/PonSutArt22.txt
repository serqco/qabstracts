Stateful Serverless Computing with Crucial.


Serverless computing greatly simplifies the use of cloud resources.
{{background}}
In particular, Function-as-a-Service (FaaS)
platforms enable programmers to develop applications as individual functions that can run and scale independently.
{{background}}
Unfortunately, applications that require fine-grained support for mutable state and synchronization,
such as machine learning (ML) and scientific computing, are notoriously hard to build with this new paradigm.
{{gap}}
In this work, we aim at bridging this gap.
{{objective}}
We present Crucial, a system to program highly-parallel
stateful serverless applications.
{{objective}}
Crucial retains the simplicity of serverless computing.
{{objective}}
It is built upon the
key insight that FaaS resembles to concurrent programming at the scale of a datacenter.
{{design}}
Accordingly, a distributed shared memory layer is the natural answer to the needs for fine-grained state management and
synchronization.
{{design}}
Crucial allows to port effortlessly a multi-threaded code base to serverless, where it can
benefit from the scalability and pay-per-use model of FaaS platforms.
{{design}}
We validate Crucial with the help of
micro-benchmarks and by considering various stateful applications.
{{method}}
Beyond classical parallel tasks (e.g., a
Monte Carlo simulation), these applications include representative ML algorithms such as k-means and logistic regression.
{{method}}
Our evaluation shows that Crucial obtains superior or comparable performance to Apache
Spark at similar cost (18%â€“40% faster).
{{result}}
We also use Crucial to port (part of) a state-of-the-art multi-threaded
ML library to serverless.
{{method}}
The ported application is up to 30% faster than with a dedicated high-end server.
{{result}}
Finally, we attest that Crucial can rival in performance with a single-machine, multi-threaded implementation of a complex coordination problem.
{{result:u1}}
Overall, Crucial delivers all these benefits with less than 6% of
changes in the code bases of the evaluated applications.
