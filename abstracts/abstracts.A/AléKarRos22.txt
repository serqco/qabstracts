Practitioners&apos; best practices to Adopt, Use or Abandon Model-based Testing with Graphical models for Software-intensive Systems.

Model-based testing (MBT) has been extensively researched for software-intensive systems but, despite the academic interest, adoption of the technique in industry has been
sparse.
{{}}
This phenomenon has been observed by our industrial partners for MBT with graphical models.
{{}}
They perceive one cause to be a lack of evidence-based MBT guidelines
that, in addition to technical guidelines, also take non-technical aspects into account.
{{}}
This
hypothesis is supported by a lack of such guidelines in the literature.
{{}}
Objective:
{{}}
The objective of this study is to elicit, and synthesize, MBT expertsâ€™ best practices for MBT with graphical models.
{{}}
The results aim to give guidance to practitioners and
aspire to give researchers new insights to inspire future research.
{{}}
Method:
{{}}
An interview survey is conducted using deep, semi-structured, interviews with an
international sample of 17 MBT experts, in different roles, from software industry.
{{}}
Interview
results are synthesised through semantic equivalence analysis and verified by MBT experts
from industrial practice.
{{}}
Results:
{{}}
13 synthesised conclusions are drawn from which 23 best-practice guidelines are
derived for the adoption, use and abandonment of the technique.
{{}}
In addition, observations
and expert insights are discussed that help explain the lack of wide-spread adoption of MBT
with graphical models in industrial practice.
{{}}
Conclusions:
{{}}
Several technical aspects of MBT are covered by the results as well as conclusions that cover process- and organizational factors.
{{}}
These factors relate to the mindset,
knowledge, organization, mandate and resources that enable the technique to be used effectively within an organization.
{{}}
The guidelines presented in this work complement existing
knowledge and, as a primary objective, provide guidance for industrial practitioners to better
succeed with MBT with graphical models.
