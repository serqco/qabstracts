Sentinel: A Hyper-Heuristic for the Generation of Mutant Reduction Strategies.

Mutation testing is an effective approach to evaluate and strengthen software test suites, but its adoption is currently limited
by the mutants' execution computational cost.
{{background}}
Several strategies have been proposed to reduce this cost (a.k.a.
mutation cost
reduction strategies), however none of them has proven to be effective for all scenarios since they often need an ad-hoc manual
selection and configuration depending on the software under test (SUT).
{{gap}}
In this paper, we propose a novel multi-objective evolutionary
hyper-heuristic approach, dubbed Sentinel, to automate the generation of optimal cost reduction strategies for every new SUT.
{{objective}}
We
evaluate Sentinel by carrying out a thorough empirical study involving 40 releases of 10 open-source real-world software systems and
both baseline and state-of-the-art strategies as a benchmark.
{{method}}
We execute a total of 4,800 experiments, and evaluate their results with
both quality indicators and statistical significance tests, following the most recent best practice in the literature.
{{method}}
The results show that
strategies generated by Sentinel outperform the baseline strategies in 95 percent of the cases always with large effect sizes.
{{result}}
They also
obtain statistically significantly better results than state-of-the-art strategies in 88 percent of the cases, with large effect sizes for
95 percent of them.
{{result}}
Also, our study reveals that the mutation strategies generated by Sentinel for a given software version can be used
without any loss in quality for subsequently developed versions in 95 percent of the cases.
{{result}}
These results show that Sentinel is able to
automatically generate mutation strategies that reduce mutation testing cost without affecting its testing effectiveness (i.e., mutation
score), thus taking off from the tester's shoulders the burden of manually selecting and configuring strategies for each SUT.
