Revisiting the building of past snapshots - a replication and reproduction study.

Context Building past source code snapshots of a software product is necessary both for
research (analyzing the past state of a program) and industry (increasing trustability by
reproducibility of past versions, finding bugs by bisecting, backporting bug fixes, among
others).
{{h-background,background}}
A study by Tufano et al.
showed in 2016 that many past snapshots cannot be built.
{{background}}
Objective We replicate Tufano et al.â€™s study in 2020, to verify its results and to study what
has changed during this time in terms of compilability of a project.
{{h-objective,objective}}
Also, we extend it by
studying a different set of projects, using additional techniques for building past snapshots,
with the aim of extending the validity of its results.
{{objective}}
Method (i) Replication of the original study, obtaining past snapshots from 79 repositories
(with a total of 139,389 commits); and (ii) Reproduction of the original study on a different set of 80 large Java projects, extending the heuristics for building snapshots (300,873
commits).
{{h-method,method}}
Results We observed degradation of compilability over time, due to vanishing of dependencies and other external artifacts.
{{h-result,result:i1}}
We validated that the most influential error causing
failures in builds are missing external artifacts, and the less influential is compiling errors.
{{result:i2}}
We observed some facts that could lead to the effect of the build tool on past compilability.
{{result:i1:u1}}
Conclusions We provide details on what aspects have a strong and a shallow influence on
past compilability, giving ideas of how to improve it.
{{h-conclusion,a-result,a-conclusion}}
We could extend previous research on
the matter, but could not validate some of the previous results.
{{conclusion}}
We offer recommendations
on how to make this kind of studies more replicable.
