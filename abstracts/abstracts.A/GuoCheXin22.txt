Detecting and Augmenting Missing Key Aspects in Vulnerability Descriptions.


Security vulnerabilities have been continually disclosed and documented.
{{background}}
For the effective understanding,
management, and mitigation of the fast-growing number of vulnerabilities, an important practice in documenting vulnerabilities is to describe the key vulnerability aspects, such as vulnerability type, root cause,
affected product, impact, attacker type, and attack vector.
{{background}}
In this article, we first investigate 133,639 vulnerability reports in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database over the past 20 years.
{{method}}
We
find that 56%, 85%, 38%, and 28% of CVEs miss vulnerability type, root cause, attack vector, and attacker type,
respectively.
{{result}}
By comparing the differences of the latest updated CVE reports across different databases, we
observe that 1,476 missing key aspects in 1,320 CVE descriptions were augmented manually in the National
Vulnerability Database (NVD), which indicates that the vulnerability database maintainers try to complete
the vulnerability descriptions in practice to mitigate such a problem.
{{method,result}}
To help complete the missing information of key vulnerability aspects and reduce human efforts, we propose a neural-network-based approach called PMA to predict the missing key aspects of a vulnerability based
on its known aspects.
{{design}}
We systematically explore the design space of the neural network models and empirically identify the most effective model design in the scenario.
{{design}}
Our ablation study reveals the prominent
correlations among vulnerability aspects when predicting.
{{method,result}}
Trained with historical CVEs, our model achieves
88%, 71%, 61%, and 81% in F1 for predicting the missing vulnerability type, root cause, attacker type, and
attack vector of 8,623 “future” CVEs across 3 years, respectively.
{{method,result}}
Furthermore, we validate the predicting
performance of key aspect augmentation of CVEs based on the manually augmented CVE data collected
from NVD, which confirms the practicality of our approach.
{{method,a-result}}
We finally highlight that PMA has the ability
to reduce human efforts by recommending and augmenting missing key aspects for vulnerability databases,
and to facilitate other research works such as severity level prediction of CVEs based on the vulnerability
descriptions.
