Guidelines for Assessing the Accuracy of Log Message Template Identification Techniques.

Log message template identification aims to convert raw logs con-
taining free-formed log messages into structured logs to be pro-
cessed by automated log-based analysis, such as anomaly detection
and model inference.
{{background}}
While many techniques have been proposed
in the literature, only two recent studies provide a comprehensive
evaluation and comparison of the techniques using an established
benchmark composed of real-world logs.
{{background}}
Nevertheless, we argue
that both studies have the following issues:
{{gap}}
(1) they used differ-
ent accuracy metrics without comparison between them, (2) some
ground-truth (oracle) templates are incorrect, and (3) the accuracy
evaluation results do not provide any information regarding incor-
rectly identified templates.
{{gap}}
In this paper, we address the above issues by providing three
guidelines for assessing the accuracy of log template identification
techniques:
{{objective}}
(1) use appropriate accuracy metrics, (2) perform oracle
template correction, and (3) perform analysis of incorrect templates.
{{design}}
We then assess the application of such guidelines through a compre-
hensive evaluation of 14 existing template identification techniques
on the established benchmark logs.
{{method}}
Results show very different in-
sights than existing studies and in particular a much less optimistic
outlook on existing techniques.
