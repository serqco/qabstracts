Over the last two decades, agile software development has gained popularity among software engineering re­
searchers and practitioners.
{{}}
However, the development and use of theories in agile research remain relatively
low.
{{}}
While analyzing publications on agile software development in the Scopus database from the last decade, we
found that only 7% of the papers used or developed a theory.
{{}}
This trend seems stable.
{{}}
However, it is promising
that most theory-centric studies use or propose theories to address cognitive and behavioral aspects of people
working in agile development.
{{}}
We argue that these aspects build fundamental pillars in agile software devel­
opment.
{{}}
In this special section, we introduce extended versions of four papers selected from the XP2020 Con­
ference.
{{}}
These papers make valuable contributions to aspects of learning and behavior in agile software
development.
{{}}
We encourage researchers to be more theory-centric in their future empirical studies of agile
methods and practices by familiarizing themselves with existing theories and applying and developing theories.
{{}}
This way, they can contribute to a reliable, evidence-based body of knowledge in our community.
