Change-Patterns Mapping: A Boosting Way for Change Impact Analysis.

Change impact analysis (CIA) is a specialized process of program comprehension that investigates the ripple effects of a
code change in a software system.
{{}}
In this paper, we present a boosting way for change impact analysis via mapping the historical
change-patterns to current CIA task in a cross-project scenario.
{{}}
The change-patterns reflect the coupling dependencies between
changed entities in a change set.
{{}}
A traditional CIA tool (such as ImpactMiner) outputs an initial impact set for a starting entity.
{{}}
To boost
the traditional CIA tool, our approach retrieves an equivalent entity from various historical change sets for the starting entity.
{{}}
Then, the
change-patterns between the equivalent entity and the rest of entities in the change set are mapped to the CIA task at hand.
{{}}
For current
CIA task, if an entity in the initial impact set involves the similar change-pattern with the starting entity when comparing with the mapped
change-pattern, we will reward the impacted confidence of the entity.
{{}}
Accuracy improvements are observed in the experiments when
applying our boosting method to three famous CIA tools, i.e., ImpactMiner, JRipples and ROSE.
