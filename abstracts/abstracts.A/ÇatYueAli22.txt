The use of Deep learning in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) is gaining popularity due to its ability to bring
intelligence to CPS behaviors.
{{}}
However, both CPSs and deep learning have inherent uncertainty.
{{}}
Such uncertainty, if not handled adequately, can lead to unsafe CPS behavior.
{{}}
The first step toward addressing such
uncertainty in deep learning is to quantify uncertainty.
{{}}
Hence, we propose a novel method called NIRVANA
(uNcertaInty pRediction ValidAtor iN Ai) for prediction validation based on uncertainty metrics.
{{}}
To this end,
we first employ prediction-time Dropout-based Neural Networks to quantify uncertainty in deep learning
models applied to CPS data.
{{}}
Second, such quantified uncertainty is taken as the input to predict wrong labels
using a support vector machine, with the aim of building a highly discriminating prediction validator model
with uncertainty values.
{{}}
In addition, we investigated the relationship between uncertainty quantification and
prediction performance and conducted experiments to obtain optimal dropout ratios.
{{}}
We conducted all the
experiments with four real-world CPS datasets.
{{}}
Results show that uncertainty quantification is negatively correlated to prediction performance of a deep learning model of CPS data.
{{}}
Also, our dropout ratio adjustment
approach is effective in reducing uncertainty of correct predictions while increasing uncertainty of wrong
predictions.
