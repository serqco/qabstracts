Software Engineering for AI-Based Systems: A Survey.


AI-based systems are software systems with functionalities enabled by at least one AI component (e.g., for
image-, speech-recognition, and autonomous driving).
{{background}}
AI-based systems are becoming pervasive in society
due to advances in AI.
{{background}}
However, there is limited synthesized knowledge on Software Engineering (SE)
approaches for building, operating, and maintaining AI-based systems.
{{gap}}
To collect and analyze state-of-theart knowledge about SE for AI-based systems, we conducted a systematic mapping study.
{{objective}}
We considered 248
studies published between January 2010 and March 2020.
{{method}}
SE for AI-based systems is an emerging research
area, where more than 2/3 of the studies have been published since 2018.
{{result}}
The most studied properties of
AI-based systems are dependability and safety.
{{result}}
We identified multiple SE approaches for AI-based systems,
which we classified according to the SWEBOK areas.
{{result:i1,method}}
Studies related to software testing and software quality
are very prevalent, while areas like software maintenance seem neglected.
{{result:i2}}
Data-related issues are the most
recurrent challenges.
{{result:i1}}
Our results are valuable for:
{{conclusion}}
researchers, to quickly understand the state-of-the-art and
learn which topics need more research; practitioners, to learn about the approaches and challenges that SE
entails for AI-based systems; and, educators, to bridge the gap among SE and AI in their curricula.
