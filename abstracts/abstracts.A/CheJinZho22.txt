Aligned metric representation based balanced multiset ensemble learning for heterogeneous defect prediction.

Context:
{{h-background}}
Heterogeneous defect prediction (HDP) refers to the defect prediction across projects with different
metrics.
{{background}}
Most existing HDP methods map source and target data into a common metric space where each
dimension has no actual meaning, which weakens their interpretability.
{{gap}}
Besides, HDP always suffers from the
class imbalance problem.
{{gap}}
Objective:
{{h-objective}}
For deficiencies of current HDP methods, we intend to propose a novel HDP approach that can
reduce the heterogeneity of source and target data and deal with imbalanced data while retaining the actual
meaning for each dimension of constructed common metric space.
{{objective}}
Method:
{{h-method}}
We propose an Aligned Metric Representation based Balanced Multiset Ensemble learning (BMEL+
AMR) approach for HDP.
{{design}}
AMR consists of shared, source-specific, and target-specific metrics.
{{design}}
It is built by
learning the translation from shared to specific metrics and reducing the distribution difference.
{{design}}
To deal with
imbalanced data, we design BMEL that constructs multiple balanced subsets for source data and produces an
aggregated classifier for predicting labels of target data.
{{design}}
Result:
{{h-result}}
Experimental results on 22 public projects indicate that (1) among all competing methods, BMEL+AMR
achieves the best performance on all indicators except Popt, followed by AMR; (2) compared with AMR, the
introduction of BMEL improves the performance on non-effort-aware indicators statistically significantly except
F1-score; compared with BMEL, the introduction of AMR improves the performance throughout all indicators
statistically significantly.

Conclusion:
{{h-conclusion}}
BMEL+AMR can effectively improve HDP performance by eliminating heterogeneity and dealing
with imbalanced data, and AMR is helpful to explain the prediction model.
