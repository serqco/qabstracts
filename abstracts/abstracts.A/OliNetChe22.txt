Different, Really! A comparison of Highly-Configurable Systems and Single Systems.

Context:
{{}}
The development of systems that handle configuration options according to a specific environment
is considered a hard activity.
{{}}
These kind of systems, Highly-Configurable Systems (HCS) are perceived by
researchers and developers as complex and difficult to maintain due to the necessity of handling variation
points.
{{}}
Although this perception is reported in the literature, no prior study investigated the differences
between HCS and Single Systems (SS).
{{}}
Objective:
{{}}
This study investigated similarities and differences between HCS and SS using well known metrics
from the literature according to three different perspectives:
{{}}
product perspective (bug-proneness, complexity,
and change size); process perspective (number of contributors, number of core developers, and accidental
contributors); and people perspective (contributor retention and number of paid contributors).
{{}}
Method:
{{}}
To perform this comparison, we collected data from two surveys and from a mining study (within
15,769 releases of 124 GitHub projects written in C).
{{}}
Results:
{{}}
In general, we identified that for the majority of the metrics, the perception of practitioners and
researchers about HCS and SS is different from our mining results.
{{}}
Conclusion:
{{}}
The identification of similarities and differences of HCS and SS will help to initiate a discussion
and further research in this direction.
