VulCNN: An Image-inspired Scalable Vulnerability Detection System.

Since deep learning (DL) can automatically learn features from
source code, it has been widely used to detect source code vulnera-
bility.
{{background}}
To achieve scalable vulnerability scanning, some prior stud-
ies intend to process the source code directly by treating them as
text.
{{background}}
To achieve accurate vulnerability detection, other approaches
consider distilling the program semantics into graph representa-
tions and using them to detect vulnerability.
{{background}}
In practice, text-based
techniques are scalable but not accurate due to the lack of program
semantics.
{{background}}
Graph-based methods are accurate but not scalable since
graph analysis is typically time-consuming.
{{background}}
In this paper, we aim to achieve both scalability and accuracy on
scanning large-scale source code vulnerabilities.
{{objective}}
Inspired by exist-
ing DL-based image classification which has the ability to analyze
millions of images accurately, we prefer to use these techniques
to accomplish our purpose.
{{design}}
Specifically, we propose a novel idea
that can efficiently convert the source code of a function into an
image while preserving the program details.
{{design}}
We implement Vul-
CNN and evaluate it on a dataset of 13,687 vulnerable functions and
26,970 non-vulnerable functions.
{{method}}
Experimental results report that
VulCNN can achieve better accuracy than eight state-of-the-art vul-
nerability detectors (i.e., Checkmarx, FlawFinder, RATS, TokenCNN,
VulDeePecker, SySeVR, VulDeeLocator, and Devign).
{{result:u1}}
As for scalability,
VulCNN is about four times faster than VulDeePecker and SySeVR,
about 15 times faster than VulDeeLocator, and about six times faster
than Devign.
{{result}}
Furthermore, we conduct a case study on more than
25 million lines of code and the result indicates that VulCNN can
detect large-scale vulnerability.
{{result:i1u1}}
Through the scanning reports, we
finally discover 73 vulnerabilities that are not reported in NVD.

Hypothesis: Authors of non-structured abstracts often perceive a need to 
announce that the next sentence will state the top-level goal and use
"In this paper" or the like for this purpose.
This is in contrast to conclusions, which are not often announced in similar manner.
