Software system comparison with semantic source code embeddings.

This paper presents a novel approach for comparing software systems by calculating the
robust Hausdorff distance between semantic source code embeddings of individual software components, i.e., methods.
{{objective}}
The proposed approach represents each software as a set
of vectors, where every vector is a semantic source code embedding of a particular method.
{{design}}
The code embeddings are constructed from abstract syntax trees of the methods with the
help of attention-based neural network models that capture the semantics of the methods.
{{design}}
Previous research has shown that comparing semantic source code embeddings can reveal
semantic relationships between the two methods.
{{background}}
We utilize this characteristic to estimate
the semantic similarity between the two software systems by computing the robust Hausdorff distance.
{{design}}
In the experiment, a pre-trained code2vec neural network model is used to
create the source code vector representations of several open-source Java-based libraries.
{{method}}
Several variations of the robust Hausdorff distance are evaluated.
{{method:i1}}
The results show that the
proposed approach can effectively estimate the semantic similarity, reflecting the software
library's scopes, software evolution, and individual parts (e.g., packages) of those libraries.
