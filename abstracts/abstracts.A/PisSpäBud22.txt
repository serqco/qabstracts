Fluently specifying taint-flow queries with fluentTQL.

Previous work has shown that taint analyses are only useful if correctly customized to the
context in which they are used.
{{background}}
Existing domain-specific languages (DSLs) allow such customization through the definition of deny-listing data-flow rules that describe potentially
vulnerable or malicious taint-flows.
{{background}}
These languages, however, are designed primarily for
security experts who are expected to be knowledgeable in taint analysis.
{{background}}
Software developers, however, consider these languages to be complex.
{{background}}
This paper thus presents fluentTQL,
a query specification language particularly for taint-flows.
{{objective}}
fluentTQL is internal Java DSL
and uses a fluent-interface design.
{{design}}
fluentTQL queries can express various taint-style vulnerability types, e.g. injections, cross-site scripting or path traversal.
{{design}}
This paper describes
fluentTQLâ€™s abstract and concrete syntax and defines its runtime semantics.
{{a-design}}
The semantics are independent of any underlying analysis and allows evaluation of fluentTQL queries
by a variety of taint analyses.
{{design}}
Instantiations of fluentTQL, on top of two taint analysis
solvers, Boomerang and FlowDroid, show and validate fluentTQL expressiveness.
{{a-result}}
Based
on existing examples from the literature, we have used fluentTQL to implement queries for
11 popular security vulnerability types in Java.
{{method}}
Using our SQL injection specification, the
Boomerang-based taint analysis found all 17 known taint-flows in the OWASP WebGoat
application, whereas with FlowDroid 13 taint-flows were found.
{{result}}
Similarly, in a vulnerable
version of the Java Spring PetClinic application, the Boomerang-based taint analysis found
all seven expected taint-flows.
{{method,result}}
In seven real-world Android apps with 25 expected malicious taint-flows, 18 taint-flows were detected.
{{method,result}}
In a user study with 26 software developers,
fluentTQL reached a high usability score.
{{method,result:i1}}
In comparison to CODEQL, the state-of-the-art
DSL by Semmle/GitHub, participants found fluentTQL more usable and with it they were
able to specify taint analysis queries in shorter time.
