ExAIS: Executable AI Semantics.

Neural networks can be regarded as a new programming paradigm,
i.e., instead of building ever-more complex programs through (often
informal) logical reasoning in the programmers’ mind, complex
‘AI’ systems are built by optimising generic neural network models
with big data.
{{}}
In this new paradigm, AI frameworks such as Ten-
sorFlow and PyTorch play a key role, which is as essential as the
compiler for traditional programs.
{{}}
It is known that the lack of a
proper semantics for programming languages (such as C), i.e., a
correctness specification for compilers, has contributed to many
problematic program behaviours and security issues.
{{}}
While it is
in general hard to have a correctness specification for compilers
due to the high complexity of programming languages and their
rapid evolution, we have a unique opportunity to do it right this
time for neural networks (which have a limited set of functions,
and most of them have stable semantics).
{{}}
In this work, we report
our effort on providing a correctness specification of neural net-
work frameworks such as TensorFlow.
{{}}
We specify the semantics of
almost all TensorFlow layers in the logical programming language
Prolog.
{{}}
We demonstrate the usefulness of the semantics through
two applications.
{{}}
One is a fuzzing engine for TensorFlow, which
features a strong oracle and a systematic way of generating valid
neural networks.
{{}}
The other is a model validation approach which
enables consistent bug reporting for TensorFlow models.
