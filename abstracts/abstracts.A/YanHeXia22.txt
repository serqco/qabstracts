A comprehensive empirical study on bug characteristics of deep learning frameworks.

Context:
{{h-background}}
Deep Learning (DL) frameworks enable developers to build DNN models without learning the
underlying algorithms and models.
{{background}}
While some of these DL-based software systems have been deployed in
safety-critical areas, such as self-driving cars and medical diagnostics, for DL frameworks, characterizing their
bugs and thus helping researchers to design specific quality assurance techniques become desperately needed.
{{gap}}
Objective:
{{h-objective}}
Our research aims to characterize bugs typical of DL frameworks at the source code level for an
in-depth analysis of bug symptoms, root causes, and bug fixes.
{{objective}}
In this way, we hope to provide insights for
researchers to design automatic quality assurance techniques, such as automatic repair techniques and fault
location techniques, applicable to DL frameworks and DL-based software systems.
{{objective}}
Method:
{{h-method}}
We started by summarizing the DL framework reference architecture and proposing the DL framework
bug taxonomy.
{{method:i1}}
Then, we mined 1,127 DL framework bug reports from eight popular DL frameworks and
labeled the bug types, root causes, and symptoms.
{{method:i1u1}}
Finally, we discussed the bug characteristics and explored
how developers could possibly deal with these bugs.
{{method}}
Results:
{{h-result}}
Our main findings are:
{{result}}
(i) DNN model building bugs and general type bugs accounted for one-third
of the total defects.
{{result:u1}}
(ii) DNN model building bugs are more prone to algorithm logic constraints, internal API
errors, and data/numerical errors.
{{result:u1}}
(iii) Fifteen bug-fixing patterns are summarized, providing reference for
common DL framework bug repair and future research on the development of automatic DL framework bug
detection tools.
{{result,fposs}}
Conclusion:
{{h-conclusion}}
By analyzing the bug-fixing changes, we characterize the occurrences, root causes, symptoms,
and fixing of these bugs.
{{summary}}
The study results have provided researchers with insights into how to ensure DL
framework quality and presented actionable suggestions for DL framework developers to improve their code
quality.

"...become desperately needed": We could compile a list of words for what is presumably
strong hyperbole and study those spots. We have not coded those much yet.
