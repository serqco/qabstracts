FlakiMe: Laboratory-Controlled Test Flakiness Impact Assessment.

Much research on software testing makes an implicit assumption
that test failures are deterministic such that they always witness
the presence of the same defects.
{{}}
However, this assumption is not
always true because some test failures are due to so-called flaky
tests, i.e., tests with non-deterministic outcomes.
{{}}
To help testing re-
searchers better investigate flakiness, we introduce a test flakiness
assessment and experimentation platform, called FlakiMe.
{{}}
FlakiMe
supports the seeding of a (controllable) degree of flakiness into the
behaviour of a given test suite.
{{}}
Thereby, FlakiMe equips researchers
with ways to investigate the impact of test flakiness on their tech-
niques under laboratory-controlled conditions.
{{}}
To demonstrate the
application of FlakiMe, we use it to assess the impact of flakiness on
mutation testing and program repair (the PRAPR and ARJA meth-
ods).
{{}}
These results indicate that a 10% flakiness is sufficient to affect
the mutation score, but the effect size is modest (2% - 5% ), while it
reduces the number of patches produced for repair by 20% up to
100% of repair problems; a devastating impact on this application of
testing.
{{}}
Our experiments with FlakiMe demonstrate that flakiness
affects different testing applications in very different ways, thereby
motivating the need for a laboratory-controllable flakiness impact
assessment platform and approach such as FlakiMe.

Test flakiness is the property of a test case and system under test,
that the test can pass on one occasion, yet fail on another, without
the tester changing anything other than the fact that the test is
executed on two different occasions.
