GitHub Discussions: An exploratory study of early adoption.

Discussions is a new feature of GitHub for asking questions or discussing topics outside of
specific Issues or Pull Requests.

Before being available to all projects in December 2020,
it had been tested on selected open source software projects.

To understand how developers use this novel feature, how they perceive it, and how it impacts the development
processes, we conducted a mixed-methods study based on early adopters of GitHub discussions from January until July 2020.
{{objective,method}}
We found that:
{{result}}
(1) errors, unexpected behavior, and
code reviews are prevalent discussion categories; (2) there is a positive relationship between
project member involvement and discussion frequency; (3) developers consider GitHub Discussions useful but face the problem of topic duplication between Discussions and Issues;
(4) Discussions play a crucial role in advancing the development of projects; and (5) positive sentiment in Discussions is more frequent than in Stack Overflow posts.
{{result,claim}}
Our findings
are a first step towards data-informed guidance for using GitHub Discussions, opening up
avenues for future work on this novel communication channel.
