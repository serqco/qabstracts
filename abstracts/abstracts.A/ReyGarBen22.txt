Cronista: A multi-database automated provenance collection system for runtime-models.

Context:
{{h-background}}
Decision making by software systems that face uncertainty needs tracing to support understandability,
as accountability is crucial.
{{background}}
While logging has been essential to support explanations and understandability of
behaviour, several issues still persist, such as the high cost for managing large logs, not knowing what to log,
and the inability of logging techniques to relate events to each other or to specific occurrences of high-level
activities in the system.
{{gap}}
Objective:
{{h-objective}}
Cronista is an alternative to logging for systems that act on top of runtime models.
{{design}}
Instead of
targeting the running systems, Cronista automatically collects the provenance of changes made to the runtime
models, which aim at leveraging high-level representations, to produce more concise historical records.
{{design}}
The
provenance graphs capture causal links between those changes and the activities of the system, which are used
to investigate issues.
{{design}}
Method:
{{h-method}}
Cronistaâ€™s architecture is described with the current design and the implementation of its high-level
components for single-machine, multi-threaded systems.
{{a-design}}
Cronista is applied to a traffic-simulation case study.
{{method}}
The trade-offs of two different storage solutions are evaluated, i.e. the CDO model repositories, and JanusGraph
graph databases.
{{method}}
Results:
{{h-result}}
Integrating Cronista into the case study requires only minor code changes.
{{result}}
Cronista collected provenance graphs for the simulations as they ran, using both CDO and JanusGraph.
{{design,-ignorediff}}
Both solutions highlighted the
cause of a seeded defect in the system.
{{result}}
For the longer executions, both CDO and JanusGraph showed negligible
overhead on the simulation times.
{{result:i1}}
Querying and visualisation tools were more user-friendly in JanusGraph than
in CDO.
{{result:i1}}
Conclusion:
{{h-conclusion}}
Cronista demonstrates the feasibility of recording fine-grained provenance for the evolution of
runtime models, while using it to investigate issues.
{{conclusion}}
User convenience and resource requirements need to be
balanced.
{{conclusion}}
The paper present how the available technologies studied offer different trade-offs to satisfy the
balance required.
