Guaranteeing Timed Opacity using Parametric Timed Model Checking.


Information leakage can have dramatic consequences on systems security.
{{background}}
Among harmful information leaks,
the timing information leakage occurs whenever an attacker successfully deduces confidential internal information.
{{background}}
In this work, we consider that the attacker has access (only) to the system execution time.
{{objective}}
We address
the following timed opacity problem:
{{objective}}
given a timed system, a private location and a final location, synthesize
the execution times from the initial location to the final location for which one cannot deduce whether the
system went through the private location.
{{objective}}
We also consider the full timed opacity problem, asking whether
the system is opaque for all execution times.
{{objective}}
We show that these problems are decidable for timed automata
(TAs) but become undecidable when one adds parameters, yielding parametric timed automata (PTAs).
{{result}}
We
identify a subclass with some decidability results.
{{result:i1}}
We then devise an algorithm for synthesizing PTAs parameter valuations guaranteeing that the resulting TA is opaque.
{{result}}
We finally show that our method can also apply
to program analysis.
