Trust Enhancement Issues in Program Repair.

Automated program repair is an emerging technology that seeks
to automatically rectify bugs and vulnerabilities using learning,
search, and semantic analysis.
{{background}}
Trust in automatically generated
patches is necessary for achieving greater adoption of program
repair.
{{background}}
Towards this goal, we survey more than 100 software practi-
tioners to understand the artifacts and setups needed to enhance
trust in automatically generated patches.
{{objective,method}}
Based on the feedback
from the survey on developer preferences, we quantitatively evalu-
ate existing test-suite based program repair tools.
{{a-method}}
We find that they
cannot produce high-quality patches within a top-10 ranking and
an acceptable time period of 1 hour.
{{result}}
The developer feedback from
our qualitative study and the observations from our quantitative
examination of existing repair tools point to actionable insights to
drive program repair research.
{{conclusion}}
Specifically, we note that producing
repairs within an acceptable time-bound is very much dependent on
leveraging an abstract search space representation of a rich enough
search space.
{{conclusion}}
Moreover, while additional developer inputs are valu-
able for generating or ranking patches, developers do not seem to
be interested in a significant human-in-the-loop interaction.
