Why secret detection tools are not enough: It's not just about false positives - An industrial case study.

Checked-in secrets in version-controlled software projects pose security risks to software
and services.
{{background}}
Secret detection tools can identify the presence of secrets in the code, commit
changesets, and project version control history.
{{background}}
As these tools can generate false positives, developers are provided with mechanisms to bypass the warnings generated from
these tools.
{{background}}
Providing this override mechanism can result in developers sometimes exposing
secrets in software repositories.
{{background}}
The goal of this article is to aid software security practitioners in understanding whyâ€˜ secrets are checked into repositories, despite being warned
by tools, through an industrial case study of analysis of usage data of a secret detection
tool and a survey of developers who bypassed the tool alert.
{{objective,method:i2}}
In this case study, we analyzed
the usage data of a checked-in secret detection tool used widely by a software company and
we surveyed developers who bypassed the warnings generated by the tool.
{{method:i2}}
From the case
study, we found that, despite developers classified 50% of the warning as false positive,
developers also bypassed the warning due to time constraints, working with non-shipping
projects, technical challenges of eliminating secrets completely from the version control history, technical debts, and perceptions that check-ins are low risk.
{{result}}
We advocate practitioners
and researchers to investigate the findings of our study further to improve secret detection tools and related development practices.
{{conclusion}}
We also advocate that organizations should
insert secondary checks, as is done by the company we studied, to capture occasions where
developers incorrectly bypass secret detection tools.
