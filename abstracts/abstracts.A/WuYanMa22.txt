On the usage and development of deep learning compilers: an empirical study on TVM.

Recent advances in deploying deep learning (DL) models have inspired the innovation of
DL compilers from both industry and academia such as Facebook Glow and TVM.
{{background}}
Given
the importance of DL compilers, we seek for answering the important question to ease
the adoption and development of TVM:
{{objective}}
What challenges do users face when using DL
compilers and what are common challenges for developers when developing DL compilers.
{{objective}}
This paper presents the first empirical study on identifying the challenges in both usage and
development of a DL compiler.
{{objective}}
We choose TVM as the representative DL compiler and
manually inspect 347 sampled posts from its official discuss forum.
{{method}}
We identify a taxonomy
of challenges in usage of TVM consisting of 15 categories and seven types of common
topics about developing TVM.
{{result}}
Furthermore, we characterize TVM bugs in total of four
impacts to obtain an initial understanding on defects of TVM through manual inspection of
44 bug reports and propose five implications for both developers and researchers in order to
improve the development practices and build more robust DL compilers.
