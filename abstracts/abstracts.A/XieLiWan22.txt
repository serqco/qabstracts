Deep learning has recently been widely applied to many applications across different domains, e.g., image
classification and audio recognition.
{{}}
However, the quality of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) still raises concerns in the practical operational environment, which calls for systematic testing, especially in safety-critical
scenarios.
{{}}
Inspired by software testing, a number of structural coverage criteria are designed and proposed
to measure the test adequacy of DNNs.
{{}}
However, due to the blackbox nature of DNN, the existing structural
coverage criteria are difficult to interpret, making it hard to understand the underlying principles of these
criteria.
{{}}
The relationship between the structural coverage and the decision logic of DNNs is unknown.
{{}}
Moreover, recent studies have further revealed the non-existence of correlation between the structural coverage
and DNN defect detection, which further posts concerns on what a suitable DNN testing criterion should be.
