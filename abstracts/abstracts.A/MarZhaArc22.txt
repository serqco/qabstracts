RESTful web services are often used for building a wide variety of enterprise applications.
{{}}
The diversity and
increased number of applications using RESTful APIs means that increasing amounts of resources are spent
developing and testing these systems.
{{}}
Automation in test data generation provides a useful way of generating
test data in a fast and efficient manner.
{{}}
However, automated test generation often results in large test suites
that are hard to evaluate and investigate manually.
{{}}
This article proposes a taxonomy of the faults we have found using search-based software testing techniques applied on RESTful APIs.
{{}}
The taxonomy is a first step in understanding, analyzing, and ultimately
fixing software faults in web services and enterprise applications.
{{}}
We propose to apply a density-based clustering algorithm to the test cases evolved during the search to allow a better separation between different
groups of faults.
{{}}
This is needed to enable engineers to highlight and focus on the most serious faults.
{{}}
Tests were automatically generated for a set of eight case studies, seven open-source and one industrial.
{{}}
The test cases generated during the search are clustered based on the reported last executed line and based on
the error messages returned, when such error messages were available.
{{}}
The tests were manually evaluated
to determine their root causes and to obtain additional information.
{{}}
The article presents a taxonomy of the faults found based on the manual analysis of 415 faults in the eight
case studies and proposes a method to support the classification using clustering of the resulting test cases.
