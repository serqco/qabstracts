Analysing app reviews for software engineering: a systematic literature review.

App reviews found in app stores can provide critically valuable information to help software
engineers understand user requirements and to design, debug, and evolve software products.
{{background}}
Over the last ten years, a vast amount of research has been produced to study what useful
information might be found in app reviews, and how to mine and organise such information as efficiently as possible.
{{background}}
This paper presents a comprehensive survey of this research,
covering 182 papers published between 2012 and 2020.
{{objective}}
This survey classifies app review
analysis not only in terms of mined information and applied data mining techniques but also,
and most importantly, in terms of supported software engineering activities.
{{method}}
The survey also
reports on the quality and results of empirical evaluation of existing techniques and identifies important avenues for further research.
{{method,a-result}}
This survey can be of interest to researchers
and commercial organisations developing app review analysis techniques and to software
engineers considering to use app review analysis.
