A teamwork effectiveness model for agile software development.

Teamwork is crucial in software development, particularly in agile development teams
which are cross-functional and where team members work intensively together to develop
a cohesive software solution.
{{background}}
Effective teamwork is not easy; prior studies indicate
challenges with communication, learning, prioritization, and leadership.
{{background}}
Nevertheless,
there is much advice available for teams, from agile methods, practitioner literature, and
general studies on teamwork to a growing body of empirical studies on teamwork in the
specific context of agile software development.
{{background}}
This article presents the agile teamwork
effectiveness model (ATEM) for colocated agile development teams.
{{objective}}
The model is based
on evidence from focus groups, case studies, and multi-vocal literature and is a revision of
a general team effectiveness model.
{{design}}
Our model of agile teamwork effectiveness is
composed of shared leadership, team orientation, redundancy, adaptability, and peer
feedback.
{{design}}
Coordinating mechanisms are needed to facilitate these components.
{{design}}
The
coordinating mechanisms are shared mental models, communication, and mutual trust.
{{design}}
We critically examine the model and discuss extensions for very small, multi-team,
distributed, and safety-critical development contexts.
{{design}}
The model is intended for researchers, team members, coaches, and leaders in the agile community.
