Managing Episodic Volunteers in Free/Libre/Open Source Software Communities.

We draw on the concept of episodic volunteering (EV) from the general volunteering literature to identify practices for
managing EV in free/libre/open source software (FLOSS) communities.
{{background}}
Infrequent but ongoing participation is widespread, but the
practices that community managers are using to manage EV, and their concerns about EV, have not been previously documented.
{{background,gap}}
We
conducted a policy Delphi study involving 24 FLOSS community managers from 22 different communities.
{{method}}
Our panel identified 16
concerns related to managing EV in FLOSS, which we ranked by prevalence.
{{result}}
We also describe 65 practices for managing EV in
FLOSS.
{{result}}
Almost three-quarters of these practices are used by at least three community managers.
{{result}}
We report these practices using a
systematic presentation that includes context, relationships between practices, and concerns that they address.
{{method}}
These findings provide
a coherent framework that can help FLOSS community managers to better manage episodic contributors.

Rare case of an implicit objective statement:
"Infrequent but ongoing participation is widespread, but the practices that community managers 
are using to manage EV, and their concerns about EV, have not been previously documented."
