Towards cost-effective API deprecation: A win-win strategy for API developers and API users.

API deprecation, which enables API developers to assist API users in migration tasks, has been widely employed
in API removal management.
{{}}
However, mismanaged API deprecation will cause unnecessary cost and bring
negligible benefit to API users.
{{}}
Cost-effective investments in API deprecation become challenges for API
developers.
{{}}
In this work, an iterative model for cost-effective investments in API deprecation is developed.
{{}}
The model provides a data-driven mechanism for API developers to iteratively make investments in API
deprecation.
{{}}
A tool named AWARE (A Win–win Assistant for API REmoval management) is also developed
for API developers to accurately assess the benefit from the perspective of API usage statistics.
{{}}
Based on the
prioritized benefit, API developers can allocate appropriate resources on API deprecation.
{{}}
A case study is
performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the iterative model with AWARE.
{{}}
The evaluation result shows that
the cost paid by API developers can be reduced significantly while the benefit brought to API users can be
increased.
{{}}
A win–win strategy for API deprecation can be achieved.
