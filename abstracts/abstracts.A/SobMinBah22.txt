Continuous and Proactive Software Architecture Evaluation: An IoT Case.


Design-time evaluation is essential to build the initial software architecture to be deployed.
{{background}}
However, experts'
assumptions made at design-time are unlikely to remain true indefinitely in systems that are characterized by
scale, hyperconnectivity, dynamism, and uncertainty in operations (e.g. IoT).
{{background}}
Therefore, experts' design-time
decisions can be challenged at run-time.
{{background}}
A continuous architecture evaluation that systematically assesses
and intertwines design-time and run-time decisions is thus necessary.
{{background}}
This paper proposes the first proactive approach to continuous architecture evaluation of the system leveraging the support of simulation.
{{objective}}
The
approach evaluates software architectures by not only tracking their performance over time, but also forecasting their likely future performance through machine learning of simulated instances of the architecture.
{{design:u1}}
This enables architects to make cost-effective informed decisions on potential changes to the architecture.
{{design}}
We perform an IoT case study to show how machine learning on simulated instances of architecture can
fundamentally guide the continuous evaluation process and influence the outcome of architecture decisions.
{{method}}
A series of experiments is conducted to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the approach.
{{a-method}}
We
also provide the architect with recommendations on how to best benefit from the approach through choice
of learners and input parameters, grounded on experimentation and evidence.
