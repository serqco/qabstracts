Causality-Based Neural Network Repair.

Neural networks have had discernible achievements in a wide range
of applications.
{{}}
The wide-spread adoption also raises the concern
of their dependability and reliability.
{{}}
Similar to traditional decision-
making programs, neural networks can have defects that need to
be repaired.
{{}}
The defects may cause unsafe behaviors, raise security
concerns or unjust societal impacts.
{{}}
In this work, we address the
problem of repairing a neural network for desirable properties such
as fairness and the absence of backdoor.
{{}}
The goal is to construct a
neural network that satisfies the property by (minimally) adjusting
the given neural network’s parameters (i.e., weights).
{{}}
Specifically,
we propose CARE (CAusality-based REpair), a causality-based
neural network repair technique that 1) performs causality-based
fault localization to identify the ‘guilty’ neurons and 2) optimizes the
parameters of the identified neurons to reduce the misbehavior.
{{}}
We
have empirically evaluated CARE on various tasks such as backdoor
removal, neural network repair for fairness and safety properties.
{{}}
Our experiment results show that CARE is able to repair all neural
networks efficiently and effectively.
{{}}
For fairness repair tasks, CARE
successfully improves fairness by 61.91% on average.
{{}}
For backdoor
removal tasks, CARE reduces the attack success rate from over 98%
to less than 1%.
{{}}
For safety property repair tasks, CARE reduces the
property violation rate to less than 1%.
{{}}
Results also show that thanks
to the causality-based fault localization, CARE’s repair focuses on
the misbehavior and preserves the accuracy of the neural networks.

Neural networks have had discernible achievements in a wide range
of applications, ranging from medical diagnosis [66], facial recog-
nition [53], fraud detection [19] and self-driving [6].
{{}}
While neural
networks are demonstrating excellent performance, there has been
a growing concern on whether they are reliable and dependable.
{{}}
Similar to traditional decision-making programs, neural networks
inevitably have defects and need to be repaired at times.
