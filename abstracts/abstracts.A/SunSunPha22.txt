Causality-Based Neural Network Repair.

Neural networks have had discernible achievements in a wide range
of applications.
{{background}}
The wide-spread adoption also raises the concern
of their dependability and reliability.
{{background}}
Similar to traditional decision-
making programs, neural networks can have defects that need to
be repaired.
{{background}}
The defects may cause unsafe behaviors, raise security
concerns or unjust societal impacts.
{{background}}
In this work, we address the
problem of repairing a neural network for desirable properties such
as fairness and the absence of backdoor.
{{objective}}
The goal is to construct a
neural network that satisfies the property by (minimally) adjusting
the given neural network’s parameters (i.e., weights).
{{objective}}
Specifically,
we propose CARE (CAusality-based REpair), a causality-based
neural network repair technique that 1) performs causality-based
fault localization to identify the ‘guilty’ neurons and 2) optimizes the
parameters of the identified neurons to reduce the misbehavior.
{{design}}
We
have empirically evaluated CARE on various tasks such as backdoor
removal, neural network repair for fairness and safety properties.
{{method:i1}}
Our experiment results show that CARE is able to repair all neural
networks efficiently and effectively.
{{claim}}
For fairness repair tasks, CARE
successfully improves fairness by 61.91% on average.
{{result}}
For backdoor
removal tasks, CARE reduces the attack success rate from over 98%
to less than 1%.
{{result}}
For safety property repair tasks, CARE reduces the
property violation rate to less than 1%.
{{result:i1}}
Results also show that thanks
to the causality-based fault localization, CARE’s repair focuses on
the misbehavior and preserves the accuracy of the neural networks.

Lots of to-me-incredible statements that _could_ be coded as claim.
