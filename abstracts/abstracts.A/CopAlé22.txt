A taxonomy of metrics for GUI-based testing research: A systematic literature review.

Context:
{{h-background}}
GUI-based testing is a sub-field of software testing research that has emerged in the last three decades.
{{background}}
GUI-based testing techniques focus on verifying the functional conformance of the system under test (SUT)
through its graphical user interface.
{{background}}
However, despite the research domains growth, studies in the field have
low reproducibility and comparability.
{{background}}
One observed cause of these phenomena is identified as a lack of
research rigor and commonly used metrics, including coverage metrics.
{{gap}}
Objective:
{{h-objective}}
We aim to identify the most commonly used metrics in the field and formulate a taxonomy of
coverage metrics for GUI-based testing research.
{{objective}}
Method:
{{h-method}}
We adopt an evidence-based approach to build the taxonomy through a systematic literature review
of studies in the GUI-based testing domain.
{{method}}
Identified papers are then analyzed with Open and Axial Coding
techniques to identify hierarchical and mutually exclusive categories of metrics with common characteristics,
usages, and applications.
{{method}}
Results:
{{h-result}}
Through the analysis of 169 papers and 315 metric definitions, we obtained a taxonomy with 55
codes (common names for metrics), 17 metric categories, and 4 higher level categories:
{{result}}
Functional Level, GUI
Level, Model Level and Code Level.
{{result}}
We measure a higher number of mentions of Model and Code level metrics
over Functional and GUI level metrics.
{{result:i4}}
Conclusions:
{{h-conclusion}}
We propose a taxonomy for use in future GUI-based testing research to improve the general
quality of studies in the domain.
{{objective}}
In addition, the taxonomy is perceived to help enable more replication
studies as well as macro-analysis of the current body of research.
