"Did You Miss My Comment or What?" Understanding Toxicity in Open Source Discussions.


Online toxicity is ubiquitous across the internet and its negative
impact on the people and that online communities that it effects
has been well documented.
{{background}}
However, toxicity manifests differently
on various platforms and toxicity in open source communities,
while frequently discussed, is not well understood.
{{gap}}
We take a first
stride at understanding the characteristics of open source toxicity
to better inform future work on designing effective intervention
and detection methods.
{{objective}}
To this end, we curate a sample of 100 toxic
GitHub issue discussions combining multiple search and sampling
strategies.
{{method}}
We then qualitatively analyze the sample to gain an
understanding of the characteristics of open-source toxicity.
{{method}}
We
find that the pervasive forms of toxicity in open source differ from
those observed on other platforms like Reddit of Wikipedia.
{{result}}
In our
sample, some of the most prevalent forms of toxicity are entitled,
demanding, and arrogant comments from project users as well as
insults arising from technical disagreements.
{{result}}
In addition, not all toxicity was written by people external to the projects; project
members were also common authors of toxicity.
{{result:i1}}
We als discuss
the implications of our findings.
{{a-conclusion}}
Among others we hope that our
findings will be useful for future detection work.
