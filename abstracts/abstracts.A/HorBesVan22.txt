Using contextual knowledge in interactive fault localization.

Tool support for automated fault localization in program debugging is limited because stateof-the-art algorithms often fail to provide efficient help to the user.
{{background}}
They usually offer a
ranked list of suspicious code elements, but the fault is not guaranteed to be found among
the highest ranks.
{{background}}
In Spectrum-Based Fault Localization (SBFL) – which uses code coverage information of test cases and their execution outcomes to calculate the ranks –, the
developer has to investigate several locations before finding the faulty code element.
{{background}}
Yet,
all the knowledge she a priori has or acquires during this process is not reused by the SBFL
tool.
{{background}}
There are existing approaches in which the developer interacts with the SBFL algorithm by giving feedback on the elements of the prioritized list.
{{background}}
We propose a new approach
called iFL which extends interactive approaches by exploiting contextual knowledge of the
user about the next item in the ranked list (e.
g., a statement), with which larger code entities (e.
g., a whole function) can be repositioned in their suspiciousness.
{{objective}}
We implemented
a closely related algorithm proposed by Gong et al., called TALK.
{{method}}
First, we evaluated iFL
using simulated users, and compared the results to SBFL and TALK.
{{method}}
Next, we introduced
two types of imperfections in the simulation:
{{method}}
user’s knowledge and confidence levels.
{{method}}
On
SIR and Defects4J, results showed notable improvements in fault localization efficiency,
even with strong user imperfections.
{{result:i1}}
We then empirically evaluated the effectiveness of the
approach with real users in two sets of experiments:
{{method}}
a quantitative evaluation of the successfulness of using iFL, and a qualitative evaluation of practical uses of the approach with
experienced developers in think-aloud sessions.
