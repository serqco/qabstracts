Collaborative program comprehension via software visualization in extended reality.

Context:
{{h-background}}
In software visualization research, various approaches strive to create immersive environments by
employing extended reality devices.
{{background}}
In that context, only few research has been conducted on the effect of
collaborative, i.e., multi-user, extended reality environments.
{{gap}}
Objective:
{{h-objective}}
We present our journey toward a web-based approach to enable (location-independent) collaborative program comprehension using desktop, virtual reality, and mobile augmented reality devices.
{{objective}}
Method:
{{h-method}}
We designed and implemented three multi-user modes in our web-based live trace visualization tool
ExplorViz.
{{design}}
Users can employ desktop, mobile, and virtual reality devices to collaboratively explore software
visualizations.
{{design}}
We conducted two preliminary user studies in which subjects evaluated our VR and AR modes
after solving common program comprehension tasks.
{{method}}
Results:
{{h-result}}
The VR and AR environments can be suitable for collaborative work in the context of program
comprehension.
{{result:u1}}
The analyzed feedback revealed problems regarding the usability, e.g., readability of
visualized entities and performance issues.
{{result:i2}}
Nonetheless, our approach can be seen as a blueprint for other
researchers to replicate or build upon these modes and results.
{{fposs}}
Conclusions:
{{h-conclusion}}
ExplorViz's multi-user modes are our approach to enable heterogeneous collaborative software
visualizations.
{{summary}}
The preliminary results indicate the need for more research regarding effectiveness, usability,
and acceptance.
{{fneed}}
Unlike related work, we approach the latter by introducing a multi-user augmented reality
environment for software visualizations based on off-the-shelf mobile devices.
