Combinatorial Testing of RESTful APIs.

This paper presents RestCT, a systematic and fully automatic ap-
proach that adopts Combinatorial Testing (CT) to test RESTful APIs.
{{objective}}
RestCT is systematic in that it covers and tests not only the in-
teractions of a certain number of operations in RESTful APIs, but
also the interactions of particular input-parameters in every single
operation.
{{design}}
This is realised by a novel two-phase test case generation
approach, which first generates a constrained sequence covering
array to determine the execution orders of available operations,
and then applies an adaptive strategy to generate and refine sev-
eral constrained covering arrays to concretise input-parameters of
each operation.
{{design}}
RestCT is also automatic in that its application
relies on only a given Swagger specification of RESTful APIs.
{{design}}
The
creation of CT test models (especially, the inferring of dependency
relationships in both operations and input-parameters), and the
generation and execution of test cases are performed without any
human intervention.
{{design}}
Experimental results on 11 real-world RESTful
APIs demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of RestCT.
{{method,result:i2}}
In
particular, RestCT can find eight new bugs, where only one of them
can be triggered by the state-of-the-art testing tool of RESTful APIs.
