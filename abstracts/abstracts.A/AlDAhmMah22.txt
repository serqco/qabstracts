An end-to-end deep learning system for requirements classification using recurrent neural networks.

Context:
{{h-background}}
Existing requirements classification approaches mainly use lexical and syntactical features to classify
requirements using both traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches with promising results.
{{background}}
However, the existing techniques depend on word and sentence structures and employ preprocessing and
feature engineering techniques to classify requirements from textual natural language documents.
{{gap}}
Moreover,
existing studies deal with requirements classification as binary or multiclass classification problems and not
as multilabel classification, although a given requirement can belong to multiple classes at the same time.
{{gap}}
Objective:
{{h-objective}}
The objective of this study is to classify requirements into functional and different non-functional
types with minimal preprocessing and to model the task as a multilabel classification problem.
{{objective}}
Method:
{{h-method}}
In this paper, we use Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Neural Networks (BiGRU) to classify requirements
using raw text.
{{design}}
We investigated two different approaches:
{{design}}
(i) using word sequences as tokens and (ii) using
character sequences as tokens.
{{design}}
Results:
{{h-result}}
Experiments conducted on the publicly available PROMISE and EHR datasets show the effectiveness
of the presented techniques.
{{method,result}}
We achieve state-of-the-art results on most of the tasks using word sequences as
tokens.
{{result:i1}}
Conclusion:
{{h-conclusion}}
Requirements can be effectively classified into functional and different non-functional categories
using the presented recurrent neural networks-based deep learning system, which involves minimal text
prepossessing and no feature engineering.
