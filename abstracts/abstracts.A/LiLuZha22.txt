SmartFast: an accurate and robust formal analysis tool for Ethereum smart contracts.

Recently, although state-of-the-art (SOTA) tools were designed and developed to analyze
the vulnerabilities of smart contracts on Ethereum, security incidents caused by these vulnerabilities are still widespread.
{{}}
This can be attributed to the fact that each tool has various
standards for judging the severity of vulnerabilities.
{{}}
More importantly, tools fail to identify
all the vulnerabilities accurately and comprehensively as the evolution of vulnerabilities.
{{}}
To this end, we first propose a vulnerability assessment model to unify the vulnerability measurement standards.
{{}}
Next, we design a static analysis tool called SmartFast, which
expresses the contract source code as a novel intermediate representation named SmartIR.
{{}}
Using preset rules and taint tracking technology, SmartFast matches SmartIR to locate the
vulnerability code.
{{}}
Furthermore, SmartFast can recommend the optimization of the contract
code automatically.
{{}}
Finally, we implement a prototype of SmartFast with 25K lines of code
and compare it with 7 SOTA tools on three datasets (a total of 13,687 public contracts).
{{}}
The results indicate that SmartFast is efficient (only took a few seconds per contract) and
robust (0.4% failure rate and resistance to the general code confusion methods).
{{}}
Besides,
compared with other tools, SmartFast can detect more kinds of vulnerabilities (119) with a
higher precision rate (98.43%) and a recall rate (85.12%), which confirms the conclusion of
the theoretical analysis in the paper.
