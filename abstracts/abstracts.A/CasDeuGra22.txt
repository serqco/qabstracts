Detecting privacy requirements from User Stories with NLP transfer learning models.

Context:
{{h-background}}
To provide privacy-aware software systems, it is crucial to consider privacy from the very beginning
of the development.
{{background}}
However, developers do not have the expertise and the knowledge required to embed the
legal and social requirements for data protection into software systems.
{{gap}}
Objective:
{{h-objective}}
We present an approach to decrease privacy risks during agile software development by automatically detecting privacy-related information in the context of user story requirements, a prominent notation in
agile Requirement Engineering (RE).
{{objective}}
Methods:
{{h-method}}
The proposed approach combines Natural Language Processing (NLP) and linguistic resources with
deep learning algorithms to identify privacy aspects into User Stories.
{{design:i1}}
NLP technologies are used to extract
information regarding the semantic and syntactic structure of the text.
{{design:i1}}
This information is then processed by a
pre-trained convolutional neural network, which paved the way for the implementation of a Transfer Learning
technique.
{{design}}
We evaluate the proposed approach by performing an empirical study with a dataset of 1680 user
stories.
{{method}}
Results:
{{h-result}}
The experimental results show that deep learning algorithms allow to obtain better predictions than
those achieved with conventional (shallow) machine learning methods.
{{result:i2}}
Moreover, the application of Transfer
Learning allows to considerably improve the accuracy of the predictions, ca. 10%.
{{result}}
Conclusions:
{{h-conclusion}}
Our study contributes to encourage software engineering researchers in considering the opportunities to automate privacy detection in the early phase of design, by also exploiting transfer learning
models.
