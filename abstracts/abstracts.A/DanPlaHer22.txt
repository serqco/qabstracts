Identifying Challenges for OSS Vulnerability Scanners - A Study & Test Suite.

The use of vulnerable open-source dependencies is a known problem in today’s software development.
{{background}}
Several
vulnerability scanners to detect known-vulnerable dependencies appeared in the last decade, however, there exists no case study
investigating the impact of development practices, e.g., forking, patching, re-bundling, on their performance.
{{gap}}
This paper studies (i)
types of modifications that may affect vulnerable open-source dependencies and (ii) their impact on the performance of vulnerability
scanners.
{{objective}}
Through an empirical study on 7,024 Java projects developed at SAP, we identified four types of modifications:
{{method}}
recompilation, re-bundling, metadata-removal and re-packaging.
{{result}}
In particular, we found that more than 87 percent (56 percent, resp.) of
the vulnerable Java classes considered occur in Maven Central in re-bundled (re-packaged, resp.) form.
{{method}}
We assessed the impact of
these modifications on the performance of the open-source vulnerability scanners OWASP Dependency-Check (OWASP) and Eclipse
Steady, GitHub Security Alerts, and three commercial scanners.
{{method}}
The results show that none of the scanners is able to handle all the
types of modifications identified.
{{result}}
Finally, we present Achilles, a novel test suite with 2,505 test cases that allow replicating the
modifications on open-source dependencies.
