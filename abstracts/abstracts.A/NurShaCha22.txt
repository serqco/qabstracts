Context:
{{}}
Human values such as inclusion, privacy, and accessibility need to be considered during software
development to attract and maintain users.
{{}}
However, little effort has been made to study human values
consideration in software development, particularly in software development artefacts.
{{}}
Objective:
{{}}
Issue discussion is potentially a rich source for human values analysis because it is a common place
for users and developers to share and communicate their concerns.
{{}}
This paper aims to investigate the extent
to which human values are discussed and whether the presence of values differs across projects.
{{}}
Method:
{{}}
We carried out a case study to discover human values in 1,097 issues collected from three Android
projects:
{{}}
Signal, K-9, and Focus.
{{}}
Results:
{{}}
We identified 20 value themes and proposed a contextualised software engineering description for
each of them.
{{}}
The analysis shows that privacy, freedom, usability, and efficiency were the prevalent value
themes in the issue discussions of these three projects.
{{}}
Meanwhile, Self-direction - Action and Security Personal are the common prevalent human values found in the projects.
{{}}
Moreover, we found that a statement
of values from the apps and their functionalities could contribute to the presence of values.
{{}}
Conclusion:
{{}}
The results suggest that human values are present in software development artefacts, for which
automated tools can be developed to extract and classify human values from them.
