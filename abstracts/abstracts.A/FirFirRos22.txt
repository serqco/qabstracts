Engineering Web Augmentation software: A development method for enabling end-user maintenance.

Nowadays, end-users are able to adapt Web applications when some of their requirements have not been taken
into account by developers.
{{background}}
One possible way to do adaptations is by using Web Augmentation techniques.
{{background}}
Web
Augmentation allows end-users to modify the Web sites’ user interfaces once these are loaded on the clientside, i.e., in the browser.
{{background}}
They achieve these adaptations by developing and/or installing Web browser plugins
("augmenters") that modify the user interface with new functionalities.
{{background}}
This particular kind of software artifacts
requires special attention regarding maintenance as–in most cases–they depend on third-party resources, such
as HTML pages.
{{background}}
When these resources are upgraded, unexpected results during the augmentation process may
occur.
{{background}}
Many communities have arisen around Web Augmentation, and today there are large repositories where
developers share their augmenters; end-users may give feedback about existing augmentations and even ask for
new ones.
{{background}}
Maintenance is a key phase in the augmenters' life-cycle, and currently, this task falls (as usual) on
the developers.
{{background}}
In this paper, we present a participatory approach for allowing end-users without programming
skills to participate in the augmenters' maintenance phase.
{{objective}}
In order to allow this, we also provide support for
the development phase to bootstrap a first version of the augmenter and to reduce the load on developers in
both phases, development and maintenance.
{{objective}}
We present an analysis of more than eight thousand augmenters,
which helped us devise the approach.
{{method}}
Finally, we present an experiment with 48 participants to validate our
approach.
