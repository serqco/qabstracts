An empirical study on self-admitted technical debt in modern code review.

Technical debt is a sub-optimal state of development in projects.
{{background}}
In particular, the type of technical debt
incurred by developers themselves (e.g., comments that mean the implementation is imperfect and should be
replaced with another implementation) is called self-admitted technical debt (SATD).
{{background}}
In theory, technical debt
should not be left for a long period because it accumulates more cost over time, making it more difficult
to process.
{{background}}
Accordingly, developers have traditionally conducted code reviews to find technical debt.
{{background}}
In fact,
we observe that many SATD comments are often introduced during modern code reviews (MCR) that are
light-weight reviews with web applications.
{{background}}
However, it is uncertain about the nature of SATD comments
that are introduced in the review process:

impact, frequency, characteristics, and triggers.

Herein, this study
empirically examines the relationship between SATD and MCR.
{{objective}}
Our case study of 156,372 review records from the Qt and OpenStack systems shows that (i) review records
involving SATD are about 6%-7% less likely to be accepted by reviews than those without SATD; (ii) review
records involving SATD tend to require two to three more revisions compared with those without SATD;
(iii) 28-48% of SATD comments are introduced during code reviews; (iv) SATD during reviews works for
communicating between authors and reviewers; and (v) 20% of the SATD comments are introduced due to
reviewers' requests.
