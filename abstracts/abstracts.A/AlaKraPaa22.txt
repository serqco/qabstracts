The journey to technical excellence in agile software development.

Context:
{{}}
Technical excellence is a nebulous term in agile software development.
{{}}
This vagueness is risky
because it may lead to misunderstandings and to agile implementations that may overlook a key principle
of agile development.
{{}}
Objective:
{{}}
This study investigates how agile practitioners interpret the concept of technical excellence brought
up in Principle 9 of the Agile manifesto.
{{}}
Moreover, we investigate how agile practitioners put the concept into
practice and what conditions facilitate putting technical excellence into practice.
{{}}
Methods:
{{}}
We conducted semi-structured interviews with twenty agile practitioners, coded the data inductively,
and performed two sessions to validate the emerging findings.
{{}}
Results:
{{}}
We find that technical excellence is first and foremost a mindset that is underpinned by continuous
attention to sustainable code, continuous learning, and teamwork.
{{}}
Fostering technical excellence requires the
adoption of design and development practices, such as continuous architecting, and is supported by continuous
learning.
{{}}
We also identify three enabling conditions for technical excellence:
{{}}
Leadership support, customer buyin, and psychological safety.
{{}}
These enablers provide teams with leeway to nurture their pursuit of technical
excellence.
{{}}
Conclusion:
{{}}
Our findings highlight the key role of people-based strategies in promoting technical excellence
in agile software development.
{{}}
They show that the attainment of technical excellence does not only involve
technical practices.
{{}}
On the contrary, it relies on social and organizational support and, most importantly, a
mindset.
