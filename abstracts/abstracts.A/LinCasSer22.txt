Opinion Mining for Software Development: A Systematic Literature Review.


Opinion mining, sometimes referred to as sentiment analysis, has gained increasing attention in software
engineering (SE) studies.
{{background}}
SE researchers have applied opinion mining techniques in various contexts, such
as identifying developers’ emotions expressed in code comments and extracting users’ critics toward mobile apps.
{{background}}
Given the large amount of relevant studies available, it can take considerable time for researchers
and developers to figure out which approaches they can adopt in their own studies and what perils these
approaches entail.
{{background}}
We conducted a systematic literature review involving 185 papers.
{{objective}}
More specifically, we present (1) welldefined categories of opinion mining-related software development activities, (2) available opinion mining approaches, whether they are evaluated when adopted in other studies, and how their performance is compared,
(3) available datasets for performance evaluation and tool customization, and (4) concerns or limitations SE
researchers might need to take into account when applying/customizing these opinion mining techniques.
{{method}}
The results of our study serve as references to choose suitable opinion mining tools for software development
activities and provide critical insights for the further development of opinion mining techniques in the SE
domain.
