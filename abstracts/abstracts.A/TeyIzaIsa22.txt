A Fast Clustering Algorithm for Modularization of Large-Scale Software Systems.

A software system evolves over time in order to meet the needs of users.

Understanding a program is the most important
step to apply new requirements.
{{background}}
Clustering techniques through dividing a program into small and meaningful parts make it possible to
understand the program.
{{background}}
In general, clustering algorithms are classified into two categories:
{{background}}
hierarchical and non-hierarchical
algorithms (such as search-based approaches).
{{background}}
While clustering problems generally tend to be NP-hard, search-based algorithms
produce acceptable clustering and have time and space constraints and hence they are inefficient in large-scale software systems.
{{background}}
Most algorithms which currently used in software clustering fields do not scale well when applied to large and very large applications.
{{background}}
In
this paper, we present a new and fast clustering algorithm, FCA, that can overcome space and time constraints of existing algorithms
by performing operations on the dependency matrix and extracting other matrices based on a set of features.
{{objective,design}}
The experimental results
on ten small-sized applications, ten folders with different functionalities from Mozilla Firefox, a large-sized application (namely ITK), and
a very large-sized application (namely Chromium) demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves higher quality modularization
compared with hierarchical algorithms.
{{method,result:i1}}
It can also compete with search-based algorithms and a clustering algorithm based on
subsystem patterns.
{{result:i1}}
But the running time of the proposed algorithm is much shorter than that of the hierarchical and non-hierarchical
algorithms.
{{result:i1}}
