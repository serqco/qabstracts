## Coding rules

1. The basic idea of our coding is simplicity (in order to
   to make high inter-rater agreement possible):
   - a simple, fixed rule for granularity and segmenting
   - a small set of straightforward codes
2. Annotation granularity is by sentence.
   Sentences are terminated by a colon or a period.
3. Each sentence receives an annotation
   (marked by {{}}) with at least one code.
4. If necessary, a sentence (in particular a long one) can
   receive two or more codes.
   This means that some substantial part(s) of the sentence pertain to one code
   and other substantial parts pertain to another code.
   No part of any sentence pertains to two codes at once.
   

## Codebook

Note: Our annotation checking script gathers the set of codes to check
for from this file by looking for strings of the form
"code `something`".
A declaration of the form 
"code `something-else` = `something`" 
introduces `something-else` as a synonym for `something`.

Make sure all code declarations take this form and no other things do.

Codes (in alphabetical order; all codes are singular):
- code ``:  
  
- code ``:  
  
- code ``:  
  
- code ``:  
  
- code ``:  
  
- code ``:  
  
- code ``:  
  
- code `` = ``
- code `` = ``
- code `` = ``
- code `` = ``
- code `` = ``
- code `` = ``
- code `` = ``
- code `` = ``
