When a bug manifests in a user-facing application, it
is likely to be exposed through the graphical user interface (GUI).
{{background}}
Given the importance of visual information to the process of
identifying and understanding such bugs, users are increasingly
making use of screenshots and screen-recordings as a means
to report issues to developers.
{{background}}
However, when such information
is reported en masse, such as during crowd-sourced testing,
managing these artifacts can be a time-consuming process.
{{background}}
As
the reporting of screen-recordings in particular becomes more
popular, developers are likely to face challenges related to
manually identifying videos that depict duplicate bugs.
{{background}}
Due to
their graphical nature, screen-recordings present challenges for
automated analysis that preclude the use of current duplicate bug
report detection techniques.

To overcome these challenges and aid
developers in this task, this paper presents TANGO, a duplicate
detection technique that operates purely on video-based bug
reports by leveraging both visual and textual information.
{{objective,design}}
TANGO
combines tailored computer vision techniques, optical character
recognition, and text retrieval.
{{design}}
We evaluated multiple configura-
tions of TANGO in a comprehensive empirical evaluation on 4,860
duplicate detection tasks that involved a total of 180 screen-
recordings from six Android apps.
{{method}}
Additionally, we conducted
a user study investigating the effort required for developers to
manually detect duplicate video-based bug reports and compared
this to the effort required to use TANGO.
{{method}}
The results reveal that
TANGOâ€™s optimal configuration is highly effective at detecting
duplicate video-based bug reports, accurately ranking target
duplicate videos in the top-2 returned results in 83% of the tasks.
{{result}}
Additionally, our user study shows that, on average, TANGO can
reduce developer effort by over 60%, illustrating its practicality.
