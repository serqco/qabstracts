Applications depend on libraries to avoid reinvent-
ing the wheel.
{{background}}
Libraries may have incompatible changes during
evolving.
{{background}}
As a result, applications will suffer from compatibility
failures.
{{background}}
There has been much research on addressing detecting
incompatible changes in libraries, or helping applications co-
evolve with the libraries.
{{background}}
The existing solution helps the latest
application version work well against the latest library version as
an afterthought.
{{background}}
However, end users have already been suffering
from the failures and have to wait for new versions.
{{background}}
In this
paper, we propose DepOwl, a practical tool helping users prevent
compatibility failures.
{{objective}}
The key idea is to avoid using incompatible
versions from the very beginning.
{{design}}
We evaluated DepOwl on 38
known compatibility failures from StackOverflow, and DepOwl
can prevent 35 of them.
{{method,result}}
We also evaluated DepOwl using the
software repository shipped with Ubuntu-19.10.
{{method}}
DepOwl detected
77 unknown dependency bugs, which may lead to compatibility
failures.
