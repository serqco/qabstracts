Customization is a general trend in software engi-
neering, demanding systems that support variable stakeholder
requirements.
{{background}}
Two opposing strategies are commonly used to
create variants:
{{background}}
software clone&own and software configuration
with an integrated platform.
{{background}}
Organizations often start with the
former, which is cheap, agile, and supports quick innovation, but
does not scale.
{{background}}
The latter scales by establishing an integrated
platform that shares software assets between variants, but re-
quires high up-front investments or risky migration processes.
{{background}}
So,
could we have a method that allows an easy transition or even
combine the benefits of both strategies?
{{objective}}
We propose a method and
tool that supports a truly incremental development of variant-
rich systems, exploiting a spectrum between both opposing
strategies.
{{objective}}
We design, formalize, and prototype the variability-
management framework virtual platform.
{{design}}
It bridges clone&own
and platform-oriented development.
{{design}}
Relying on programming-
language-independent conceptual structures representing soft-
ware assets, it offers operators for engineering and evolving a sys-
tem, comprising:
{{design}}
traditional, asset-oriented operators and novel,
feature-oriented operators for incrementally adopting concepts
of an integrated platform.
{{design}}
The operators record meta-data that
is exploited by other operators to support the transition.
{{design}}
Among
others, they eliminate expensive feature-location effort or the
need to trace clones.
{{claim}}
Our evaluation simulates the evolution of a
real-world, clone-based system, measuring its costs and benefits.
