Developers frequently move into new teams or
environments across software companies.

Their onboarding ex-
perience is correlated with productivity, job satisfaction, and
other short-term and long-term outcomes.

The majority of the
onboarding process comprises engineering tasks such as fixing
bugs or implementing small features.

Nevertheless, we do not
have a systematic view of how tasks influence onboarding.

In
this paper, we present a case study of Microsoft, where we
interviewed 32 developers moving into a new team and 15
engineering managers onboarding a new developer into their
team – to understand and characterize developers’ onboarding
experience and expectations in relation to the tasks performed
by them while onboarding.
{{objective,method}}
We present how tasks interact with
new developers through three representative themes:
{{X}}
learning,
confidence building, and socialization.
{{X}}
We also discuss three
onboarding strategies as inferred from the interviews that
managers commonly use unknowingly, and discuss their pros
and cons and offer situational recommendations.

Furthermore,
we triangulate our interview findings with a developer survey
(N = 189) and a manager survey (N = 37) and find that
survey results suggest that our findings are representative and
our recommendations are actionable.
{{method,result}}
Practitioners could use
our findings to improve their onboarding processes, while re-
searchers could find new research directions from this study
to advance the understanding of developer onboarding.
