Background:
{{h-background}}
Researchers and practitioners have
been using code complexity metrics for decades to predict how
developers comprehend a program.
{{background}}
While it is plausible and
tempting to use code metrics for this purpose, their validity is
debated, since they rely on simple code properties and rarely
consider particularities of human cognition.
{{background}}
Aims:
{{h-objective}}
We investigate whether and how code complexity metrics
reflect difficulty of program comprehension.
{{objective}}
Method:
{{h-method}}
We have conducted a functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) study with 19 participants observing program
comprehension of short code snippets at varying complexity levels.
{{method}}
We dissected four classes of code complexity metrics and their
relationship to neuronal, behavioral, and subjective correlates of
program comprehension, overall analyzing more than 41 metrics.
{{result,method}}
Results:
{{h-result}}
While our data corroborate that complexity metrics
can—to a limited degree—explain programmers’ cognition in
program comprehension, fMRI allowed us to gain insights into
why some code properties are difficult to process.
{{result}}
In particular, a
code’s textual size drives programmers’ attention, and vocabulary
size burdens programmers’ working memory.
{{result}}
Conclusion:
{{h-conclusion}}
Our results provide neuro-scientific evidence support-
ing warnings of prior research questioning the validity of code
complexity metrics and pin down factors relevant to program
comprehension.
{{conclusion}}
Future Work:
{{h-fwork}}
We outline several follow-up experiments investigat-
ing fine-grained effects of code complexity and describe possible
refinements to code complexity metrics.
