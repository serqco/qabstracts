Ambiguity in natural-language requirements is a
pervasive issue that has been studied by the requirements en-
gineering community for more than two decades.
{{background}}
A fully manual
approach for addressing ambiguity in requirements is tedious
and time-consuming, and may further overlook unacknowledged
ambiguity – the situation where different stakeholders perceive
a requirement as unambiguous but, in reality, interpret the
requirement differently.
{{background}}
In this paper, we propose an automated
approach that uses natural language processing for handling
ambiguity in requirements.
{{objective,design}}
Our approach is based on the au-
tomatic generation of a domain-specific corpus from Wikipedia.
{{design}}
Integrating domain knowledge, as we show in our evaluation,
leads to a significant positive improvement in the accuracy of
ambiguity detection and interpretation.
{{result}}
We scope our work to
coordination ambiguity (CA) and prepositional-phrase attach-
ment ambiguity (PAA) because of the prevalence of these types
of ambiguity in natural-language requirements [1].
{{objective}}
We evaluate
our approach on 20 industrial requirements documents.
{{method}}
These
documents collectively contain more than 5000 requirements
from seven distinct application domains.
{{method}}
Over this dataset, our
approach detects CA and PAA with an average precision of
≈80% and an average recall of ≈89% (≈90% for cases of unac-
knowledged ambiguity).
{{result}}
The automatic interpretations that our
approach yields have an average accuracy of ≈85%.
{{result}}
Compared
to baselines that use generic corpora, our approach, which uses
domain-specific corpora, has ≈33% better accuracy in ambiguity
detection and ≈16% better accuracy in interpretation.
