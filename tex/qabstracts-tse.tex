{How (Not) To Write a Software Engineering Abstract}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}  % 100 to 200 words are allowed (but not enforced)
\emph{Background:}
Abstracts are a very valuable element in a software engineering research article,
but not all abstracts are as informative as they could be.
\emph{Objective:} 
Characterize the structure of abstracts in high-quality venues, 
observe and quantify deficiencies, 
suggest guidelines for writing informative abstracts.
\emph{Methods:}
Use open coding to derive concepts that explain relevant properties of abstracts
and identify the archetypical structure of abstracts.
Use quantitative content analysis to objectively characterize abstract structure
over a sample of 500!!! abstracts from five presumably high-quality venues.
Use exploratory data analysis to find recurring issues in abstracts.
Compare the prototypical structure to actual structures to derive
guidelines for producing informative abstracts.
\emph{Results:}
!!!
\emph{Conclusions:}
(1)~Even in top venues, many abstracts are far from ideal.
(2)~Structured abstracts tend to be better than unstructured ones, 
but (3)~artifact-centric works need a different structured format.
(4)~The community should start requiring conclusions that generalize, 
which currently are often missing.

\section{Introduction}
\IEEEPARstart{W}{elcome} to the article.

\subsection{Article Structure}



%========================================================================
\section{Methods}


\subsection{Overview}

\noindent
This is a mixed-method study, consisting of three nominally sequential structural parts
(Prestudy1, Prestudy2, Fullstudy) and
four overlapping and partially iterative semantic elements
(codebook development, quantitative content analysis,
statistical evaluation, interpretation).

Overall, we consider our study to be a qualitative one, but note that the middle two parts
are compatible with a positivist epistemology (with "objective" results) so that 
the final interpretation is done on an extremely solid and quantitative foundation.

Prestudy1 was for initial codebook development.
Prestudy2 was for codebook refinement\footnote{One additional big change happened
	to the codebook shortly into the Fullstudy, at a time when only Lutz Prechelt
	had started coding in the Fullstudy.},
coding procedure development,
and coder training.
Fullstudy was for all other elements.


\subsection{Data Availability}

\noindent
Full detail, including detailed execution history, available on GitHub:
Codebook, handling procedure, coded abstracts, scripts for automation, scripts for stats and plots.


\subsection{Codebook Development}

\noindent
Open coding in GTM fashion (grounding, constant comparison, concept memos).
Initially structured abstract (describe!); then discovered archetype and extended set of codes; lots of clarification during coder training.
49!!! codes; see codebook for details.
Codes for key parts are subtle ( e.g. gap must lead "directly" to objective).


\subsection{Coding Rules}

\noindent
by sentence; prefer single codes; consider only 1 sentence forward context (like readers); be friendly


\subsection{Sample}

\noindent
Presumably-top-quality venues EMSE, ICSE TR, TOSEM, TSE,
plus IST for structured abstracts.
Random sample from 2022 population.
100 each, but TOSEM smaller.


\subsection{Quantitative Content Analysis and Inter-Coder Disagreements}

\noindent
Extract abstracts from PDFs; automatically split by sentence; manually add codes in {{}};
code each abstract twice; script checks compatibility; coder B reconsiders; coder A reconsiders;
A and B discuss remainder and resolve or add -ignorediff.

Split disagreements into simple mistakes (and resolve those) and actual interpretation differences
(limits of objectivity; actually usually quality issues, see below).


\subsection{Statistical Evaluation}

\noindent
Plot-centric; straightforward; no bothering with confidence intervals.

Verbal terms for frequencies: 
rare (less than 5\%),
not rare (5-20\%),
common (20-35\%),
frequent (35-50\%),
dominant (over 50\%).


\subsection{Interpretation}

\noindent
Driven by research interest; grounded as far as possible.
Makes use of impressions not captured in the data.
Choice of examples reflects those.


%========================================================================
\section{Results}

\subsection{Design Articles vs. Empirical Articles}

\noindent
Very different character depending on main contribution.
Design articles have empirical studies, too.
Empirical articles may describe auxiliary or secondary artifacts, too.


\subsection{The Abstracts Archtetype}

\noindent



\subsection{How Not To: Missing Elements}

\noindent
Key elements (background, objective, (design), method, result, conclusion); helpful elements (summary, gap)


\subsection{How Not To: Convoluted Trains of Thought}

\noindent
Topicstructure sequences; Archetype violations.


\subsection{How Not To: Uninformative Formulations}

\noindent
Informativeness gaps; Announcements.


\subsection{How Not To: Unclear Formulations}

\noindent
Understandability gaps; Ignorediffs


\subsection{How-Not-To Summary}

\noindent
Good quality means: Follows archetype, no announcement, no gap.
Should be over 90\% of articles.


\subsection{How To: Structured Abstracts are more orderly}

\noindent
Re-analysis of "Convoluted Trains of Thought". 




%========================================================================
\section{Limitations and Threats to Validity}

\noindent
Internal: careful procedure, internal validity issues unlikely.
Construct: cannot measure informativeness; cannot measure understandability;
our proxy measures are less informative and only 90\% valid.
Generalizability: 
results should generalize to neighboring years in same venues;
results not better in second-tier venues?


%========================================================================
\section{Conclusions}


\subsection{...}
\noindent


\subsection{How To: Guidelines for Well-Written Abstracts}

\noindent
Authors: Follow archetype; write a structured abstract; consider a 'gap'; pack all information you can; formulate a take-home message (conclusion)

Venues: Prescribe structured abstracts: Background (not Context); Design (if needed); Method/Methods; Results; or: Substudy 1/Substudy 2; Conclusion

\section{Basic statistics}

\Plot{boxplots_words}{%
  Typical abstracts are 190 to 280 words long. 
  Structured abstracts tend to be longer than unstructured ones, 
  although IST abstracts overall (including the design articles) do not.}
\Plot{boxplots_sentences}{%
	Typical abstracts are 8 to 14 sentences long.
	Structured abstracts tend to be longer than unstructured ones.
	IST requires structured abstracts, the other venues do not.}
\Plot{boxplots_icount}{%
  A majority of abstracts has one or more "informativeness gaps".
  The problem tends to be smaller in structured abstracts.}
\Plot{boxplots_ucount}{%
  Some abstracts have understandability gaps where an important concept is not explained at all.
  !!!}
\Plotwide{zerofractionbar_xletgroups_topicmissingfractions}{%
	How often is a topic not present at all in an abstract?\\
	The plots in each group show these different subsets of abstracts:
	all, structured, non-structured, design, empirical, EMSE, ICSE, IST, TOSEM, TSE}
\Plotwide{box_xletgroups_topicfractions}{%
	Per-topic distribution of the amount of space used for that topic.\\
	The plots in each group show these different subsets of abstracts:
	all, structured, non-structured, design, empirical, EMSE, ICSE, IST, TOSEM, TSE}
\Plotwide{nonzerofractionbar_xletgroups_missinginfofractions}{%
	What fraction of abstracts has the following gaps?
	Only announcing (instead of describing) methods, results, conclusions, possible future research.
	Not reporting simple details ("informativeness gaps"), not explaining key terms ("understandability gaps").
	Announcing is generally not rare, in particular for results, and tends to be less pronounced
	at IST. 
	Missing to include detail once is dominant.
	Doing this several times is frequent and worse for design articles.
	Not explaining key terms is not rare and worst at EMSE.\\
	The plots in each group show these different subsets of abstracts:
	all, structured, non-structured, design, empirical, EMSE, ICSE, IST, TOSEM, TSE}
\Plot{ab_topicstructure_freqs_design}{%
  The frequency of different trains-of-thought in the abstract for design articles.
  The label is a string of stretch-code characters:
  b-ackground, g-ap, o-bjective, d-esign, m-ethod, r-esult, c-onclusion, f-uture.}
\Plot{ab_topicstructure_freqs_empir}{%
	The frequency of different trains-of-thought in the abstract for empirical articles.
	Same characters as before, except that d cannot occur.}
\Plot{boxplots_fraction_introduction}{%
	Authors invest about a third of the space into the introduction:
	background/context information and perhaps explaining a research gap.
	Structured abstracts tend to have less of this???}
\Plot{boxplots_fraction_conclusion}{%
	Many abstracts offer no conclusion, i.e., no explicit generalization of the immediate result.
	This is worst at ICSE (with over 75\%)
	and best at IST, which is the only venue where a majority of articles formulates a generalization.}
\Plot{lowess_gaps_by_fracintro}{%
	This plot checks the expectation that spending much space on background
	will correlate with more i and u gaps.
	This is not the case.
	Each dot is one coding of an abstract, 
	the line is a locally weighted linear regression.}
