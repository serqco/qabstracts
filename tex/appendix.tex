This appendix contains figures that provide additional detail for information
that is only summarized in the article proper.


\Plot{boxplots_words}{%
  Typical abstracts are 190 to 280 words long. 
  Structured abstracts tend to be longer than unstructured ones.}
\Plot{boxplots_sentences}{%
	Typical abstracts are 8 to 14 sentences long.
	The values for structured abstracts are inflated by the section headings,
	which each count as a sentence if they terminate in a colon.}
\Plot{boxplots_avg_wordlength}{%
	The average number of characters in a word is similar in all subgroups.}

\Plot{ab_topicstructure_freqs_empir_structured}{%
  The frequency of different trains-of-thought in the abstract for empirical articles
  using a structured abstract format.
  The "Method:" etc. subheadings are ignored for structured abstracts in all three plots.}


\Plot{boxplots_icount}{%
  A majority of abstracts has one or more ``informativeness gaps´´.
  The problem tends to be smaller in structured abstracts.}
\Plot{boxplots_ucount}{%
  Some abstracts have understandability gaps where an important concept is not explained at all.
  !!!}

\Plot{boxplots_fraction_introduction}{%
	Authors invest about a third of the space into the introduction:
	background/context information and perhaps explaining a research gap.
	Structured abstracts tend to have less of this???}
\Plot{boxplots_fraction_conclusion}{%
	Many abstracts offer no conclusion, i.e., no explicit generalization of the immediate result.
	This is worst at ICSE (with over 75\%)
	and best at IST, which is the only venue where a majority of articles formulates a generalization.}

\Plot{lowess_gaps_by_fracintro}{%
	This plot checks the expectation that spending much space on background
	will correlate with more i and u gaps.
	This is not the case.
	Each dot is one coding of an abstract, 
	the line is a locally weighted linear regression.}
