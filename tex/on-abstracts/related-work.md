## CroOpp06: A genre analysis of scientific abstracts

https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/00220410610700953/full/html?fullSc=1

Analyzes 12 abstracts from protozoology for their structure.
Finds 5 moves (a term from genre theory):
background, mainfeatures/purpose, method, results, conclusions/consequences.
Finds not all abstracts manage to follow that structure.
"We suggest that the lack of formal training in abstract writing increases the risk of subjectivity 
and verbosity and reduces clarity in scientific abstracts."
Good work.


## DosSantos96: The textual organization of research paper abstracts in applied linguistics

Analyzes 96 abstracts from three leading journals.
Finds 5 moves:

Describes various submoves.
"The proposed pattern may serve as a pedagogic tool".


## DupKhoLeb03: Quality of Abstracts in 3 Clinical Dermatology Journals

197 abstracts.
"Each abstract was rated by 2 independent investigators, using a 30-item quality scale 
divided into 8 categories (objective, design, setting, subjects, intervention,
measurement of variables, results, and conclusions)"
"Mean ± SD quality scores of abstracts were significantly different among journals 
(Archives of Dermatology, 0.78 ± 0.07; The British Journal of Dermatology, 0.67 ± 0.17; and 
Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology, 0.64 ± 0.15; P = .045) 
and between formats (structured, 0.71 ± 0.11; and unstructured, 0.56 ± 0.18; P = .002)."

## PitBraBur99: Accuracy of Data in Abstracts of Published Research Articles

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/189139

5*44 articles from 5 top medical journals in 1996/1997.
Abstracts considered deficient if they contained data inconsistent with body or not in the body at all.
The 5 journals had 18% to 45% deficient abstracts, a sixth had 68%.
"Many of the discrepancies identified were quite minor and not likely to cause serious misinterpretation. 
For example, 1 abstract2 reported the population to consist of "42 consecutive patients," 
whereas the body indicated it to be "44 consecutive patients of which 42 agreed to participate." 
Sometimes, however, discrepancies were more serious; 
for example, 1 abstract3 gave the estimated 15-year survival as 48%, 
whereas the body of the text indicated it to be 58%."

Finds that most have relevant gaps in the abstract's reporting and most
