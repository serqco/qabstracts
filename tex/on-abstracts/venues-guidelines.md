# Guidelines of venues regarding abstracts

created: Lutz Prechelt, 2023-07-11

What venues' "Author instructions" (etc.) say about abstracts and
where to find that information.


## EMSE and Springer

https://www.springer.com/journal/10664/submission-guidelines#Instruction%20for%20Authors_Text

    Abstract

    Please provide an abstract of 150 to 250 words. 
    The abstract should not contain any undefined abbreviations or unspecified references.


## ICSE 2022

The call for papers
https://conf.researchr.org/track/icse-2022/icse-2022-papers?#Call-for-Papers
does not provide information on article structure.
Neither does the 35-page handbook for the ACM LaTeX template.


## IST and Elsevier

    Abstract

    A concise and factual abstract is required of no more than 300 words, including headings. 
    To support this, the journal has started using (July 1, 2009) "structured abstracts". 
    A structured abstract should contain the following headings (as in-line or run-in headings in bold): 
    Context, Objective, Method, Results and Conclusions. 
    An abstract is often presented separately from the article, so it must be able to stand alone. 
    For this reason, references should be avoided, but if essential, then cite the author(s) and year(s). 
    Also, non-standard or uncommon abbreviations should be avoided, but if essential 
    they must be defined at their first mention in the abstract itself. 
    Please see below for an example of a structured abstract:

    Context: Throughout an organisation, people have different responsibilities and worktasks, 
    hence, it is probable that different roles have different priorities when it comes to 
    what should be improved within a company. 
    This has been found in previous studies in marketing, but is this true for software improvement as well?

    Objective: This paper evaluates how different roles in a software development organization 
    view different issues in software process improvement and if such differences 
    could be used in order to provide more tailor-made process improvements within an organization 
    and uses this as a working hypothesis.

    Method: A quantitative questionnaire containing five different weighted questions related to 
    software process improvement was developed. 
    84 employees from all levels of a Swedish telecommunication company were then approached, of which 63 responded.

    Results: The different roles disagreed in three of the questions while they agreed in two of the questions. 
    The disagreement was related to issues about importance of improvement, urgency of problems, 
    and threat against successful process management, 
    while the questions where the roles agreed focused on communication of the processes (documentation and teaching).

    Conclusion: It is concluded that it is important to be aware and take into account 
    the different needs of different roles. 
    This will make it possible to provide improvements tailored to specific roles 
    which will probably help to overcome resistance to process improvements. 
    It is also important to look into other areas and companies (for example, marketing) 
    where it could be beneficial when conducting process improvements.


## TOSEM and ACM

The closest match appears to be this page:
https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/information-for-authors
but I could not find guidelines regarding article structure there.


## TSE and IEEE Computer Society

From
https://journals.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/create-your-ieee-journal-article/create-the-text-of-your-article/structure-your-article/#abstract
which is not easy to find when one starts on the TSE pages.

    Abstract
    
    Your abstract should provide a brief summary of the research conducted, the conclusions reached, 
    and the potential implications of those conclusions.
    
    A strong abstract will also:
    
        - Consist of a single paragraph up to 250 words, with correct grammar and unambiguous terminology
        - Be self-contained; without abbreviations, footnotes, references, or mathematical equations
        - Highlight what is novel in your work
        - Include 3-5 keywords or phrases that describe the research to help readers find your article
    
    Most authors write the abstract last and edit it multiple times before article publication 
    to ensure it accurately captures the entire article.
    
    IEEE recommends that you do not include mathematical symbols in your article title or abstract 
    because they may not display properly.


## PLOS One

https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-qualitative-research

    Abstract
    
    The Abstract comes after the title page in the manuscript file. 
    The abstract text is also entered in a separate field in the submission system.  
    
    The Abstract should:
      - Describe the main objective(s) of the study
      - Explain how the study was done, including any model organisms used, without methodological detail
      - Summarize the most important results and their significance
      - Not exceed 300 words
    
    Abstracts should not include:
      - Citations
      - Abbreviations, if possible
