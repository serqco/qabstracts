Version Control Systems: An Information Foraging Perspective.

Version Control Systems (VCS) are an important source of information for developers.
{{}}
This calls for a principled understanding
of developers’ information seeking in VCS—both for improving existing tools and for understanding requirements for new tools.
{{}}
Our prior
work investigated empirically how and why developers seek information in VCS:
{{}}
in this paper, we complement and enrich our prior findings
by reanalyzing the data via a theory’s lens.
{{}}
Using the lens of Information Foraging Theory (IFT), we present new insights not revealed by
the prior empirical work.
{{}}
First, while looking for specific information, participants’ foraging behaviors were consistent with other foraging
situations in SE; therefore, prior research on IFT-based SE tool design can be leveraged for VCS.
{{}}
Second, in change awareness foraging,
participants consumed similar diets, but in subtly different ways than in other situations; this calls for further investigations into change
awareness foraging.
{{}}
Third, while committing changes, participants attempted to enable future foragers, but the competing needs of
different foraging situations led to tensions that participants failed to balance:
{{}}
this opens up a new avenue for research at the intersection
of IFT and SE, namely, creating forageable information.
{{}}
Finally, the results of using an IFT lens on these data provides some evidence as
to IFT’s scoping and utility for the version control domain.
