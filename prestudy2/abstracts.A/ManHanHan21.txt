The Art, Science, and Engineering of Fuzzing: A Survey.

Among the many software testing techniques available today, fuzzing has remained highly popular due to its conceptual
simplicity, its low barrier to deployment, and its vast amount of empirical evidence in discovering real-world software vulnerabilities.

At a
high level, fuzzing refers to a process of repeatedly running a program with generated inputs that may be syntactically or semantically
malformed.
{{background}}
While researchers and practitioners alike have invested a large and diverse effort towards improving fuzzing in recent
years, this surge of work has also made it difficult to gain a comprehensive and coherent view of fuzzing.
{{background}}
To help preserve and bring
coherence to the vast literature of fuzzing, this paper presents a unified, general-purpose model of fuzzing together with a taxonomy of
the current fuzzing literature.
{{objective}}
We methodically explore the design decisions at every stage of our model fuzzer by surveying the related
literature and innovations in the art, science, and engineering that make modern-day fuzzers effective.
