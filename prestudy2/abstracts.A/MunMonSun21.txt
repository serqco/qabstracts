IntRepair: Informed Repairing of Integer Overflows.

Integer overflows have threatened software applications for decades.
{{background}}
Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel technique to
provide automatic repairs of integer overflows in C source code.
{{objective}}
Our technique, based on static symbolic execution, fuses detection,
repair generation and validation.
{{design,objective}}
This technique is implemented in a prototype named INTREPAIR.
{{a-design}}
We applied INTREPAIR to 2,052 C
programs (approx.
{{method}}
1 million lines of code) contained in SAMATEâ€™s Juliet test suite and 50 synthesized programs that range up to
20 KLOC.
{{method}}
Our experimental results show that INTREPAIR is able to effectively detect integer overflows and successfully repair them,
while only increasing the source code (LOC) and binary (Kb) size by around 1 percent, respectively.
{{result:i2}}
Further, we present the results of
a user study with 30 participants which shows that INTREPAIR repairs are more than 10x efficient as compared to manually generated
code repairs.
