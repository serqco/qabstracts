A Study of Feature Scattering in the Linux Kernel.

Feature code is often scattered across a software system.
{{}}
Scattering is not necessarily bad if used with care, as
witnessed by systems with highly scattered features that evolved successfully.
{{}}
Feature scattering, often realized with a pre-processor,
circumvents limitations of programming languages and software architectures.
{{}}
Unfortunately, little is known about the principles
governing scattering in large and long-living software systems.
{{}}
We present a longitudinal study of feature scattering in the Linux kernel,
complemented by a survey with 74, and interviews with nine Linux kernel developers.
{{}}
We analyzed almost eight years of the kernelâ€™s
history, focusing on its largest subsystem:
{{}}
device drivers.
{{}}
We learned that the ratio of scattered features remained nearly constant
and that most features were introduced without scattering.
{{}}
Yet, scattering easily crosses subsystem boundaries, and highly scattered
outliers exist.
{{}}
Scattering often addresses a performance-maintenance tradeoff (alleviating complicated APIs), hardware design
limitations, and avoids code duplication.
{{}}
While developers do not consciously enforce scattering limits, they actually improve the
system design and refactor code, thereby mitigating pre-processor idiosyncrasies or reducing its use.
