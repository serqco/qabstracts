Using a balanced scorecard to identify opportunities to improve code review effectiveness: an industrial experience report.

Peer code review is a widely adopted software engineering practice to ensure code quality
and ensure software reliability in both the commercial and open-source software projects.
{{background}}
Due to the large effort overhead associated with practicing code reviews, project managers
often wonder, if their code reviews are effective and if there are improvement opportunities
in that respect.
{{gap}}
Since project managers at Samsung Research Bangladesh (SRBD) were also
intrigued by these questions, this research developed, deployed, and evaluated a productionready solution using the Balanced SCorecard (BSC) strategy that SRBD managers can use
in their day-to-day management to monitor individual developer’s, a particular project’s or
the entire organization’s code review effectiveness.
{{objective:u1,design}}
Following the four-step framework of
the BSC strategy, we– 1) defined the operation goals of this research, 2) defined a set of
metrics to measure the effectiveness of code reviews, 3) developed an automated mechanism to measure those metrics, and 4) developed and evaluated a monitoring application to
inform the key stakeholders.
{{method:i1u1}}
Our automated model to identify useful code reviews achieves
7.88% and 14.39% improvement in terms of accuracy and minority class F1 score respectively over the models proposed in prior studies.
{{result:u1}}
It also outperforms human evaluators from
SRBD, that the model replaces, by a margin of 25.32% and 23.84% respectively in terms
of accuracy and minority class F1 score.
{{result}}
In our post-deployment survey, SRBD developers
and managers indicated that they found our solution as useful and it provided them with
important insights to help their decision makings.
