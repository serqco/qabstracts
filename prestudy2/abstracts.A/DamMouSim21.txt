Learning by sampling: learning behavioral family models from software product lines.

Family-based behavioral analysis operates on a single specification artifact, referred to as
family model, annotated with feature constraints to express behavioral variability in terms
of conditional states and transitions.
{{}}
Family-based behavioral modeling paves the way for
efficient model-based analysis of software product lines.
{{}}
Family-based behavioral model
learning incorporates feature model analysis and model learning principles to efficiently
unify product models into a family model and integrate the behavior of various products into a behavioral family model.
{{}}
Albeit reasonably effective, the exhaustive analysis of
product lines is often infeasible due to the potentially exponential number of valid configurations.
{{}}
In this paper, we first present a family-based behavioral model learning techniques,
called F F SMDiff .
{{}}
Subsequently, we report on our experience on learning family models by employing product sampling.
{{}}
Using 105 products of six product lines expressed in
terms of Mealy machines, we evaluate the precision of family models learned from products selected from different settings of the T-wise product sampling criterion.
{{}}
We show that
product sampling can lead to models as precise as those learned by exhaustive analysis and
hence, reduce the costs for family model learning.
