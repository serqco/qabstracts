To automatically identify
patterns in violations and their fixes, we propose an approach that utilizes convolutional neural networks to learn features and clustering to
regroup similar instances.

In particular, we first identify software-specific terms by utilizing a software-specific corpus (e.g., Stack Overflow) and a general corpus
(e.g., Wikipedia).

Our model uses Long Short-Term Memory, a deep
learning technique, to automatically learn semantic features representing an issue report,
and combines them with the traditional textual similarity features.

ModelKB can automatically manage the
modeling lifecycle end-to-end, including (1) monitoring and tracking experiments; (2) visualizing, searching for, and comparing models and experiments; (3) deploying models locally
and on the cloud; and (4) sharing and publishing trained models.

prestudy2/abstracts.C/ScaBavVen21.txt  (Gunnar/Martin)
We try to (i)
correlate each metric with understandability and (ii) build models combining metrics to assess understandability.

#classification 2 objective,a-method  "try to" is an objective; they don't say anything about HOW

In this paper, we extended
the analysis in four different ways to validate the hypothesis uncovered in our original study.

In this work, we perform
an extensive evaluation of 121 existing as well as new code-related, documentation-related, and developer-related metrics.

Since project managers at Samsung Research Bangladesh (SRBD) were also
intrigued by these questions, this research developed, deployed, and evaluated a productionready solution using the Balanced SCorecard (BSC) strategy that SRBD managers can use
in their day-to-day management to monitor individual developer’s, a particular project’s or
the entire organization’s code review effectiveness.
