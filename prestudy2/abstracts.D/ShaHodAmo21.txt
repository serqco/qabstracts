Spearheading agile: the role of the scrum master in agile projects.

Scrum innovated the role of the scrum master in software engineering.
{{}}
The scrum master
is envisioned in agile literature as the “servant leader” who serves the team in a multitude
of different ways, which include promoting scrum, facilitating the team’s functioning, and
removing obstacles.
{{}}
However, empirical studies focusing on the role of the scrum master
in practice are scarce.
{{}}
To address this gap, a Grounded Theory study with a mixed
methods approach was carried out which included semi-structured interviews with 39
software practitioners and a questionnaire with 47 respondents.
{{}}
In this study, we present
and describe the scrum master’s role in agile projects in terms of (a) the grounded theory
of the role of the scrum master which involves everyday activities of facilitating,
mentoring, negotiating, process adapting, coordinating, and protecting; (b) the varying
involvement of the scrum master in selected agile practices carried out by the team; and
(c) a positive association between the presence of the scrum master and the frequency
with which agile practices are carried out by the team.
{{}}
This study presents for the first
time a multifaceted study of the multiple dimensions of the scrum master role and will
enable practitioners to better manage expectations of this role in practice.
