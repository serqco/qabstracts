Automatically recommending components for issue reports using deep learning.

Todayâ€™s software development is typically driven by incremental changes made to software to implement a new functionality, fix a bug, or improve its performance and security.
{{}}
Each change request is often described as an issue.
{{}}
Recent studies suggest that a set of
components (e.g., software modules) relevant to the resolution of an issue is one of the
most important information provided with the issue that software engineers often rely on.
{{}}
However, assigning an issue to the correct component(s) is challenging, especially for
large-scale projects which have up to hundreds of components.
{{}}
In this paper, we propose
a predictive model which learns from historical issue reports and recommends the most
relevant components for new issues.
{{}}
Our model uses Long Short-Term Memory, a deep
learning technique, to automatically learn semantic features representing an issue report,
