Automated end-to-end management of the modeling lifecycle in deep learning.

Deep learning has improved the state-of-the-art results in an ever-growing number of
domains.
{{background}}
This success heavily relies on the development and training of deep learning
modelsâ€“an experimental, iterative process that produces tens to hundreds of models before
arriving at a satisfactory result.
{{background}}
While there has been a surge in the number of tools and
frameworks that aim at facilitating deep learning, the process of managing the models
and their artifacts is still surprisingly challenging and time-consuming.
{{background}}
Existing modelmanagement solutions are either tailored for commercial platforms or require significant
code changes.
{{background}}
Moreover, most of the existing solutions address a single phase of the modeling lifecycle, such as experiment monitoring, while ignoring other essential tasks, such
as model deployment.
{{gap}}
In this paper, we present a software system to facilitate and accelerate the deep learning lifecycle, named ModelKB.
{{objective}}
ModelKB can automatically manage the
modeling lifecycle end-to-end, including (1) monitoring and tracking experiments; (2) visualizing, searching for, and comparing models and experiments; (3) deploying models locally
and on the cloud; and (4) sharing and publishing trained models.
{{design}}
Moreover, our system provides a stepping-stone for enhanced reproducibility.
{{claim}}
ModelKB currently supports TensorFlow
2.0, Keras, and PyTorch, and it can be extended to other deep learning frameworks easily.
