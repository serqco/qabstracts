Version Control Systems: An Information Foraging Perspective.

Version Control Systems (VCS) are an important source of information for developers.

This calls for a principled understanding
of developers’ information seeking in VCS—both for improving existing tools and for understanding requirements for new tools.

Our prior
work investigated empirically how and why developers seek information in VCS:
{{background}}
in this paper, we complement and enrich our prior findings
by reanalyzing the data via a theory’s lens.
{{objective,method:i1}}
Using the lens of Information Foraging Theory (IFT), we present new insights not revealed by
the prior empirical work.
{{method}}
First, while looking for specific information, participants’ foraging behaviors were consistent with other foraging
situations in SE; therefore, prior research on IFT-based SE tool design can be leveraged for VCS.

Second, in change awareness foraging,
participants consumed similar diets, but in subtly different ways than in other situations; this calls for further investigations into change
awareness foraging.
{{result:u2,fneed}}
Third, while committing changes, participants attempted to enable future foragers, but the competing needs of
different foraging situations led to tensions that participants failed to balance:
{{result:u1}}
this opens up a new avenue for research at the intersection
of IFT and SE, namely, creating forageable information.

Finally, the results of using an IFT lens on these data provides some evidence as
to IFT’s scoping and utility for the version control domain.

Very annoying: What IS "the data"?
