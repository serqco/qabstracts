Software development with feature toggles: practices used by practitioners.

Background Using feature toggles is a technique that allows developers to either turn a
feature on or off with a variable in a conditional statement.
{{h-background,background}}
Feature toggles are increasingly
used by software companies to facilitate continuous integration and continuous delivery.
{{background}}
However, using feature toggles inappropriately may cause problems which can have a severe
impact, such as code complexity, dead code, and system failure.
{{background}}
For example, the erroneous
repurposing of an old feature toggle caused Knight Capital Group, an American global
financial services firm, to go bankrupt due to the implications of the resultant incorrect
system behavior.
{{background}}
Aim The goal of this research project is to aid software practitioners in the use of practices
to support software development with feature toggles through an empirical study of feature
toggle practice usage by practitioners.
{{h-objective,objective,-ignorediff}}
Method We conducted a qualitative analysis of 99 artifacts from the grey literature and 10
peer-reviewed papers about feature toggles.
{{h-method,method}}
We conducted a survey of practitioners from 38
companies.
{{method:i1}}
Results We identified 17 practices in 4 categories:
{{h-result,result}}
Management practices, Initialization
practices, Implementation practices, and Clean-up practices.
{{result}}
We observed that all of the
survey respondents use a dedicated tool to create and manage feature toggles in their code.
{{result}}
Documenting feature toggleâ€™s metadata, setting up the default value for feature toggles, and
logging the changes made on feature toggles are also frequently-observed practices.
{{result:i3}}
Conclusions The feature toggle development practices discovered and enumerated in this
work can help practitioners more effectively use feature toggles.
{{h-conclusion,conclusion}}
This work can enable future
mining of code repositories to automatically identify feature toggle practices.
