What Predicts Software Developers&apos; Productivity?

Organizations have a variety of options to help their software developers become their most productive selves, from
modifying office layouts, to investing in better tools, to cleaning up the source code.
{{}}
But which options will have the biggest impact?
{{}}
Drawing from the literature in software engineering and industrial/organizational psychology to identify factors that correlate with
productivity, we designed a survey that asked 622 developers across 3 companies about these productivity factors and about self-rated
productivity.
{{}}
Our results suggest that the factors that most strongly correlate with self-rated productivity were non-technical factors,
such as job enthusiasm, peer support for new ideas, and receiving useful feedback about job performance.
{{}}
Compared to other
knowledge workers, our results also suggest that software developersâ€™ self-rated productivity is more strongly related to task variety
and ability to work remotely.
