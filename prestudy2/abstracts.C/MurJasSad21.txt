What Predicts Software Developers&apos; Productivity?

Organizations have a variety of options to help their software developers become their most productive selves, from
modifying office layouts, to investing in better tools, to cleaning up the source code.

But which options will have the biggest impact?
{{objective, background}}
Drawing from the literature in software engineering and industrial/organizational psychology to identify factors that correlate with
productivity, we designed a survey that asked 622 developers across 3 companies about these productivity factors and about self-rated
productivity.

Our results suggest that the factors that most strongly correlate with self-rated productivity were non-technical factors,
such as job enthusiasm, peer support for new ideas, and receiving useful feedback about job performance.

Compared to other
knowledge workers, our results also suggest that software developersâ€™ self-rated productivity is more strongly related to task variety
and ability to work remotely.
