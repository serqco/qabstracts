SEthesaurus: WordNet in Software Engineering.

Informal discussions on social platforms (e.g., Stack Overflow, CodeProject) have accumulated a large body of programming
knowledge in the form of natural language text.
{{}}
Natural language process (NLP) techniques can be utilized to harvest this knowledge base
for software engineering tasks.
{{}}
However, consistent vocabulary for a concept is essential to make an effective use of these NLP techniques.
{{}}
Unfortunately, the same concepts are often intentionally or accidentally mentioned in many different morphological forms (such as
abbreviations, synonyms and misspellings) in informal discussions.
{{}}
Existing techniques to deal with such morphological forms are either
designed for general English or mainly resort to domain-specific lexical rules.
{{}}
A thesaurus, which contains software-specific terms and
commonly-used morphological forms, is desirable to perform normalization for software engineering text.
{{}}
However, constructing this
thesaurus in a manual way is a challenge task.
{{}}
In this paper, we propose an automatic unsupervised approach to build such a thesaurus.
{{}}
In particular, we first identify software-specific terms by utilizing a software-specific corpus (e.g., Stack Overflow) and a general corpus
(e.g., Wikipedia).
{{}}
Then we infer morphological forms of software-specific terms by combining distributed word semantics, domain-specific
lexical rules and transformations.
{{}}
Finally, we perform graph analysis on morphological relations.
{{}}
We evaluate the coverage and accuracy of
our constructed thesaurus against community-cumulated lists of software-specific terms, abbreviations and synonyms.
{{}}
We also manually
examine the correctness of the identified abbreviations and synonyms in our thesaurus.
{{}}
We demonstrate the usefulness of our constructed
thesaurus by developing three applications and also verify the generality of our approach in constructing thesauruses from data sources in
other domains.
