# Recommended Abstract Structure

These recommendations for writing abstracts come from the empirical work presented in this repository.

1. Write a structured abstract, not a free-flowing one. Take care to avoid announcements, understandability gaps, and sentences with an unclear role. Provide helpful detail, perhaps simplified, if it consumes barely any space.
2. Write a **Background** section that provides just enough context and motivation to understand the subsequent **Objective**.
3. Decide on your main contribution. Is your article a design article or an empirical one?
Write an **Objective** that expresses both succinctly. If your background information contains a corresponding **Gap** statement, mark it as such.
1. If your work is a design article, write a **Design** section. Cover all key ideas (typically two to four), avoid non-key information.
2. If you have multiple near-independent empirical sub-studies and your work is a design article, use two or three combined **Method and Results** sections. Each of these will typically be a single sentence of the form "We do-this-and-that and find this-and-that". Otherwise write separate **Methods** and **Results** sections as follows.
3. Write a **Methods** section that explains what you have done for your empirical study.  Be as specific as you can do concisely. In particular, mention the amount of data used (see Section~\ref{igaps}).
4. Write a **Results** section that explains the main outcomes of your study. If you have many results, report the one or two most important ones. If you have many results of equal importance, report the  one or two most interesting ones or just provide examples. Be specific and beware of announcements.
5. Write a **Conclusion** section that generalizes from your results. What should the reader take home? What do we now know that we did not know before? The broader the conclusion, the higher the relevance of your work, but the lower its credibility.  Find a formulation with relevance and good enough credibility. Expect to later be proven wrong for some of your works, but not for many.
6. An outlook on future possibilities *can* be part of your **Conclusion**, but is usually better left to the body of your article.
